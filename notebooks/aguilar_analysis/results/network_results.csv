Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.     4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of unwinding our position. These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.Paulo Issler",vince.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,,,LJM,\Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_8\Notes Folders\'sent mail,2000-02-24 08:49:00-08:00

The additional two LM6000's materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional equipment through West LB ASAP:6 stacks  $1,188,0003 Control Modules $375,0001 CEMS  $675,0004 230kv Breakers $340,000Total:   $2,578,000The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.

Given our Board approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering costs.

"X-Origin: Delainey-DX-FileName: ddelain.nsfChris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 11/20/2000 11:31 AM ---------------------------Christopher F Calger11/19/2000 01:35 PMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas SaleDave,We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    Kelemen is doing a great job.In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their original bid.Calpine - PastoriaEarly in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, and their bid assumed  ""market"" for the turbines.   While they are correct (the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  AES - PastoriaSame PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  CEC Process:On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that (i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to Enron for nothing! AES-Las VegasThey seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will know more this week and will update you when we know.

The additional two LM6000's materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional equipment through West LB ASAP:6 stacks  $1,188,0003 Control Modules $375,0001 CEMS  $675,0004 230kv Breakers $340,000Total:   $2,578,000The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are minimal as follows:Now through November 1:    $257,800Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec Committe meeting in November.How does this sound to you?Regards,Chris",david.delainey@enron.com,christopher.calger@enron.com,,,PSCO,\David_Delainey_Dec2000\Notes Folders\'sent mail,2000-10-09 06:38:00-07:00

"X-Origin: Delainey-DX-FileName: ddelain.nsfChris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 11/20/2000 11:31 AM ---------------------------Christopher F Calger11/19/2000 01:35 PMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas SaleDave,We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    Kelemen is doing a great job.In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their original bid.Calpine - PastoriaEarly in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, and their bid assumed  ""market"" for the turbines.   While they are correct (the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  AES - PastoriaSame PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  CEC Process:On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that (i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to Enron for nothing! AES-Las VegasThey seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will know more this week and will update you when we know.

Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.     4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of unwinding our position. These are the main points.

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Companyexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20approximately$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=al3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=ipbetween Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 toprovide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20businessesin the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed onthe NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occurOct. 11.ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued theIPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=-upcompany that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rathermind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could openits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20followinga trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported bygrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=yI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=,TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantialoperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20profitability.""Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20""significant,""but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greetingthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that thesheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven upthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investmentsand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-upcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority ownerof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20importantacquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=lretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=ly285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eightstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customersduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anothercustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers havebeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by theT&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easilybuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming thereis a willing seller.Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferredits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesbut did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlierthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC hascome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer baseof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residentialcustomers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreatedfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make anymoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that EnronEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=gthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=alconsumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling powerto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=tiallymoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of itsretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=tsas it is the majority owner.I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablyon a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Lookingahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on thebright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, startingwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Otherkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxonand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably couldnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has beengolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being themajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approachin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customersthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secretweapon.But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competitionis not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=ia,which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitedStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have optedto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=ailmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able todo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on thetechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenuemanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, underwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=s.IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=.In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when theutility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer informationsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM haspartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Underan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS willbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under developmentby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT'sBanner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this willsurely limit TNPC's growth potential.Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20uncertaintiessurrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players inthe energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possibleexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi=ngin Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after itsrecent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20Consequently,the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges thatthe company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremelysteep.=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DLearn more about SCIENTECH's Issues and Analysis products and servicesat: http://www.consultrci.com/web/rciweb.nsf/web/Depts-IA.html=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

The call is scheduled for 11:30 CST and will last at least an hour, possibly more.  By way of background, ENE and CalPERS are 50/50 partners in JEDI II - which was created in December 1997.  JEDI II is a funding vehicle for Enron's energy related merchant investments.  Transactions of note are:  3.9% minority equity interest in EES, equity ownership in Quanta, 100% ownership of East Coast Power (since sold down to 51%), and participation in a number of E&P drilling partnerships and coal investments.  The commitment period was set to expire on December 31, 2000 - and was extended to March 31, 2001.   In addition, CalPERS invested $40 Million in The New Power Co prior to the IPO.   Andy and I are working with CalPERS to amend the current JEDI II partnership in order that we continue our successful relationship with CalPERS.  The Alternative Investment Management (AIM) staff that we work with are very supportive of Enron and we are looking at a number of opportunities to put their money to work in our businesses.  CalPERS hasn't provided any specific questions that they want answered.  My thoughts on how to structure the call is for Marty to spend some time talking about California, Enron's role there and our view of the situation.  Then, Richard could address the regulatory status in California.  I would expect this to be somewhat of a freeform conference call.  One area we may discuss is how Enron and CalPERS can team up on a California initiative.  The AIM staff is interested in discussing this particular point.  The following individuals from CalPERS senior staff will be on the call: Dan Szente, Chief Investment Officer Robert Aguallo, Chief Operating Officer Barry Gonder, Senior Investment Officer, AIM Rick Hayes, Senior Principal Investment Officer, AIM (primary Enron contact) Mark Anson, Senior Investment Officer, Public Equities Mary Cottrill, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Public Equities Lou Jug, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Real Estate Curtis Ishi, Senior Investment Officer, Fixed IncomePlease give me a call if you have any questions.

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Companyexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20approximately$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=al3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments.

It is rathermind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could openits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20followinga trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported bygrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=yI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=,TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantialoperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20profitability.""Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20""significant,""but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greetingthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that thesheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven upthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investmentsand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-upcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority ownerof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20importantacquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=lretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=ly285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eightstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customersduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anothercustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers havebeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by theT&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easilybuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming thereis a willing seller.Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferredits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesbut did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlierthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC hascome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer baseof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residentialcustomers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreatedfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make anymoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that EnronEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=gthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=alconsumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling powerto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=tiallymoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of itsretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=tsas it is the majority owner.I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablyon a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Lookingahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on thebright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, startingwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Otherkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxonand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably couldnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has beengolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being themajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approachin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customersthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secretweapon.But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competitionis not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=ia,which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitedStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have optedto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=ailmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able todo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on thetechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenuemanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, underwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=s.IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=.In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when theutility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer informationsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM haspartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Underan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS willbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under developmentby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT'sBanner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this willsurely limit TNPC's growth potential.Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20uncertaintiessurrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players inthe energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possibleexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain.

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Companyexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20approximately$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=al3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=ipbetween Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 toprovide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20businessesin the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed onthe NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occurOct. 11.ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued theIPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=-upcompany that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rathermind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could openits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20followinga trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported bygrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=yI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=,TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantialoperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20profitability.""Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20""significant,""but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greetingthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that thesheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven upthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investmentsand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-upcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority ownerof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20importantacquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=lretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=ly285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eightstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customersduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anothercustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers havebeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by theT&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easilybuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming thereis a willing seller.Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferredits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesbut did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlierthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC hascome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer baseof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residentialcustomers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreatedfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make anymoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that EnronEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=gthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=alconsumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling powerto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=tiallymoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of itsretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=tsas it is the majority owner.I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablyon a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Lookingahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on thebright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, startingwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Otherkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxonand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably couldnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has beengolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being themajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approachin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customersthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secretweapon.But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competitionis not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=ia,which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitedStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have optedto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=ailmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able todo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on thetechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenuemanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, underwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=s.IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=.In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when theutility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer informationsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM haspartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Underan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS willbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under developmentby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT'sBanner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this willsurely limit TNPC's growth potential.Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20uncertaintiessurrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players inthe energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possibleexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi=ngin Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after itsrecent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20Consequently,the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges thatthe company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremelysteep.=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DLearn more about SCIENTECH's Issues and Analysis products and servicesat: http://www.consultrci.com/web/rciweb.nsf/web/Depts-IA.html=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

"Jeff,After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric Broadband (DCB). 1. The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you met recently at the YPO gathering. 2. DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is critical to success.3. We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.4. We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested in the investment.5. DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.6. About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  7. We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commitment.8.  At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal structure by the end of May.  We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB. I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make in DCB.

While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.

"Hello KenAs we have not had a recent ""daily update"" from you - I write inquiring about the status of OUR company.We heard about the acquisition discussions with Dynegy through the press (NOT from Enron's management!).  Clearly, this does not engender confidence in the management's communication philosophy.We also heard that there is a meeting planned with Enron's banks on Friday - again through the press!  Communication failed again.Further reductions in confidence came as Enron restated it's financial statements for the period 1997 through 2000.  Again this news was provided by the press!Couple of questions for you - who were the commercial folks putting together the LJM, Chewco etc. deals?  Who were senior managers approving these deals?  Perhaps Enron should part company with some of those folks too.  Where was the board and where were you when these deals were being done?  There appears to have been no corporate governance at the relevant periods!On a personal level, I have invested many years in this company.  I currently have a holding of approx. 4,500 shares which I purchased because I believed in the company.  I also have numerous share options.  Unfortunately, this episode has obliterated my confidence in management and in particular in you and Jeff Skilling.  I suspect you guys are ok - as you had the foresight (knowledge?) to cash out your holding during the latter part of last year and most of this year.Please be aware that the fate of thousands of people rests in your hands.I would be interested to hear your views.Amita GosaliaTel: +44 20 7783 5466",amita.gosalia@enron.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,,,Update for Wednesday/Thursday?,"\KLAY (Non-Privileged)\Lay, Kenneth\Inbox",2001-11-08 10:29:54-08:00
"Mr. Lay:First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 yea=rs now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of m=y life, career-wise.  When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost sta=rry eyed.  I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates=t company I had ever been associated with.  I started out with Enron Power =Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible.I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years.  Some great, some good and= some not so good.  But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart= beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our =management have made.  But most of all, we've still got great people.  Base=d on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like= we are going to have to ""do it all over again"".  However, I am an eternal =optimist.  Looking at this in football terms...  this is a rebuilding year =and we've got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench.One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich =Kinder exuded.  I was saddened to see Mr. Kinder move on, but I was confide=nt that having you remain behind would continue our successes.  And we have= been successful.  Aside from the LJM issue (which, to be honest, I still d=on't fully understand), I think we've just had some external distractions t=hat have hampered our stock growth this year, such as Dabhol, Portland Gene=ral, California, etc., in addition to the market conditions in general. =20In the all-employee meeting, you told the troops that it was going to take =the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going i=n the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess.  I am full=y prepared to do this, however, there is one request I would like to bring =up.  I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are goi=ng to expire at the end of this year.  In all my wildest dreams (or nightma=res), I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threate=n a grant price of $21.563, but here we are.  As a dedicated and confident =employee, I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications= around me that the stock would go to 100.  Later in the year, as the stock= moved downward, I heard indications that we were going to bounce back stro=ng.  I was on board.  I was excited.  I trusted that this was the case.  In= fact, I look back on this past year and, based on what I knew at the time,= I would probably do the same thing over again.But...   that was then and this is now.  It has been painful for me, as I k=now it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company.  I wan=t to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end. =20My request is simple...    is there any way possible to extend options expi=ring at the end of this year by one year?If you want to make a good faith gesture towards long-time employees who ar=e willing to re-dedicate themselves to the daunting task at hand, I can thi=nk of nothing better for the short term.   I think extending the expiration= date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee popu=lation who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourse=lves in. =20If you can't do anything, I will understand.  I know your office has always= had an open door policy with respect to e-mail feedback, but this is the f=irst one I've ever written.  I always contend that it never hurts to ask in= a situation like this.Mark",mark.brand@enron.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,,,Options,\KLAY (Non-Privileged)\Inbox,2001-10-25 14:20:14-07:00
