Initially, we will be making markets in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference credits very quickly.The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current counterparts.  Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about these new products in late January.In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead the group and he will report to me.",vince.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,,,Credit Markets Group Organisational Announcement.,\Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_8\Notes Folders\Sent,1999-12-17 07:58:00-08:00

I think it's a veryimportant issue and really critical to Enron. The model risk represents avery significant exposure to the company: a wrong model results in baddecisions and eventually leads to accounting errors and incorrect financialstatements.Here are my comments.1. Reasons of model risk. The main source of model risk in Enron is omittedin your list. I think it's due to the fact that the responsibility for thefinal model approval and validation is dispersed in the organization andthere no single unit/person that is vested with the authority to audit,approve  and monitor valuation models. The popular perception is that this isdone by the Research Group, but this could not be further form the truth.Given the way the organization evolved over the last few years, we became agroup of internal consultants, working on highly specialized, partialproblems (sometimes, we work on a project from A to Z, but it's an exceptionto the rule).It's imperative that this is communicated to the senior management in aprecise, non-ambiguous way. I think that this is the main source of potentialproblems and the first shortcoming of the modeling process to be corrected.2. Inappropriate application of models. I would expand point 3 in your draft (inappropriate application of models)and add two lower level points: a) wrong inputs b) incorrect model used for agiven transaction. TVA is an example of point a: a transaction in case ofwhich the inputs have not been being updated for an extended period of timein the past.3. Control Strength. Under Control Strength you can mention that several audits of the Research Group model by Arthur Andersen and Darrell Duffie have beeninitiated at our insistence.4. Audit scope. I don't think you can address the issue of the model risk if you excludefrom your review Risk Analytics and IT. The model developmentactivity cannot be divided into separate, independent processes. I am afraid your recommendations will be highly inaccurate if your audit scope willremain as is.Vince KaminskiAndrew Schuleman@ENRON09/29/99 06:00 PMTo: Wanda Curry/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Model Development ReportAttached is a draft of the Model Development Report that will be presented at the Controller's Meeting on Friday, October 1, 1999.

As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will alsoneed to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are anyoverriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyershave copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line andthe ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by acounterparty with a password must ""click through"" the Agreement beforecommencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, thata counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it wasnot aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA areenforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitationsof liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that byentering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterpartyreceives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in aposition where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once thecounterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is madeand the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time thatthe counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is theapproach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing inmind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering intothe ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have hadinternal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAAoff line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents aremarked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have onlymade changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I thinkit is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have thefollowing brief comments on the changes I have made:1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by adesignated Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron groupundertakings.  The reason for this is that Transactions will actually be made between thecounterparty and various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure thatsuch Transactions with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of thesedocuments. I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we needto list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there maybe some confusion here. This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entitieswhich trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so onthe Website. The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve thisbut I assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages onthe Website depending on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplatethis.2. ""Services"":  I have removed the references to Services as I am notsure what this means. I would have thought that these agreements need to govern thecounterparty's access and utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry outany Transactions.  Therefore, I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred toServices, it can now refer to ""access and utilization of"" the Website.3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3of the ETA which provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enrongenerates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that anyelectronic records of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage adocument being attached which explains this.  This is also acceptable.4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate forrelevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. livingindividuals, rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providingappropriate wording for this, could you please let me know what information will becollected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  Forexample, when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this orcan you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or otherinformation on them once they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with yourtechnical people.Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have yourcomments.I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleaguesfor their review.

EOTT is not a party to any of the contracts involving the ""sample leases"" that are referenced in the subpoena, and the subpoena does not appear to be directed to the types of business that are conducted by EOTT.  As indicated in memos from Charles Tetrault,  the document requests are focused on EOG and ECT.  EOTT is not going to pay 25% of the legal fees associated with EOG's and ECT's response to this subpoena.I do not have a problem with paying 25% of this first bill ($1,250.79), because it was worth $1,250.79 to learn that EOTT probably will not have to provide any documents that are responsive to this subpoena.  However, until someone can convince me that the DOJ is actually interested in some EOTT transactions, I will not advise EOTT to contribute more than 5% to this effort in the future.  If we cannot agree on an allocation to EOTT that is less than 5%, then EOTT will need to make separate arrangements with respect to the minimal representation that it will apparently require with respect to this matter.Of course, should circumstances change such that EOTT becomes a focus of this investigation, then we would be willing to pay a greater share of these legal fees.  Currently, however, EOTT transactions do not appear to be of interest to the DOJ, and EOTT should not be allocated 25% of the legal fees associated with responses by other Enron affiliates to this subpoena.Please call me next week so that we may discuss EOTT's participation in this matter.Britt Davis@ENRON06/09/99 10:09 AMTo: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Walt Zimmerman/Houston/Eott@Eott, Steve Williams/EOG/Enron@Enron, Bonnie White/Corp/Enron@Enron, Robert Vote/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Michael Moran/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Brenda McAfee/Corp/Enron@Enron, Shirley Davey/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: DOJ Royalty Inquiry I have received a copy of a V&E invoice regarding the above-referenced case in the total amount of $5,003.17, which is split equally among Enron Corp., EOG, ECT, and EOTT, pursuant to the agreement of those parties.

Guaranty);2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs;3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a ""Qualified Financial Contract"" - is that applicable to this Transaction?  Might this somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?;4) Do we need to negate the reference to a ""Forward Contract"" in Section 4.6 of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this exact issue);5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example);6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.  It currently reads ""Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for a change to the terms of this Agreement."";7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).  Section 8.1(ii) currently reads:  Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld   in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself from   liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts,   revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this  Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit Support Provider issues a Credit Support   Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the execution hereof,; 8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 ""Facilities"".

I have never had the Enron RAROC training, but those who have say the training is vague on this point.  At one time, Mark Rouen apparently had a utility curve that he had derived that related the two, but I understand Enron RAROC has subsequently abondonned that approach.  Instead, they use a database of comparables and a lot of subjectivity to decide which projects get blessed.Do you have any resources you would recommend we consult on calculation of hurdle rates?  Are we thinking about this correctly, i.e., are discounting cash flows according to risk-adjusted hurdle rate the correct approach?  Are there any individuals in Houston we should speak with about the implementation of RAROC?Grant also alluded to your role in establishing RAROC at Enron and to the issue that there were some differences between your view of how RAROC should be implemented and the way it has been installed.

(I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID ""Move-Team"".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID ""EIS Billing"".",steven.kean@enron.com,elizabeth.linnell@enron.com,,,Monthly Billing - Detail Class 845 / s100061.xls,\Steven_Kean_Dec2000_1\Notes Folders\Archiving\Untitled,1999-09-06 07:06:00-07:00

""After all the research that's been done and all the data that's been collected, we don't really know what will happen when the clock strikes 12 on New Year's Eve,"" said Dr. Martin Weiss, Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc., which has been tracking Y2K compliance among major U.S. companies for more than a year. The Y2K bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year. The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake 2000 for 1900. For the energy industry, which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems, the Y2K bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments - a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter. Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly 100 percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for Y2K - a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly 50 percent reported a year ago - some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises. They point out that the Y2K situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all non-compliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth. Enron Corp. (ENE.N), a major U.S. petroleum company and pipeline operator, is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring. Despite their best efforts to upgrade their ""mission critical"" systems -- those that are essential to their business -- the company says ""there is no assurance that (our Y2K) plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron."" Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all non-compliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a ""cascading effect"" of system failures. ""The problem is not, and will not be, unique to Enron,"" the company added. Though Enron has not announced any precautionary Y2K shutdowns, a number of other major U.S. pipeline operators have. For example the Colonial Pipeline, the largest in the nation, plans an eight-hour shutdown starting on New Year's Eve. Explorer Pipeline, the second largest, plans a 20-hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year. The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston, New York and Chicago. In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions, as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers, retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal 30 day inventories, according to industry and government officials. The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at U.S. refineries, which produce the gasoline. By most accounts, refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out Y2K problems. According to Weiss Rating Co., the majority of large U.S. oil refining companies, like Exxon Corp (XON.N) and Mobil Corp. (MOB.N), are either average or above average in their adherance to Y2K plans mapped out more than a year ago, and only a handful, like Chevron Corp (CHV.N) and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp (UDS.N), are rated below average. ""While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry, refiners seem to be the more prepared,"" said Dr. Weiss. ""Over all, the energy sector appears to be taking the Y2K problem seriously - but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a non-event."" According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute (API), the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups, nearly 100 percent of the nation's refiners, retailers, and pipeline operators will be ready for the year 2000 turnover, which comes in less than two months, by having Y2K proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down. ""What the reports are saying is, the trade groups are confident these companies are going to be Y2K ready, and that's encouraging,"" said an official at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). ""But obviously nobody can make any guarantees.""

""After all the research that's been done and all the data that's been collected, we don't really know what will happen when the clock strikes 12 on New Year's Eve,"" said Dr. Martin Weiss, Chairman of Weiss Ratings Inc., which has been tracking Y2K compliance among major U.S. companies for more than a year. The Y2K bug refers to a software glitch in some older computers that only recognize the final two digits in a year. The glitch could result in malfunctions if the computers mistake 2000 for 1900. For the energy industry, which depends on the electrical grid as well as internal computer systems, the Y2K bug could lead to unsafe operations at refineries and to shortages in fuel shipments - a daunting possibility for the leading nation in energy consumption at the height of winter. Despite trade group survey results that claim nearly 100 percent of the oil and gas industry will be ready for Y2K - a far more encouraging percentage than the roughly 50 percent reported a year ago - some companies say it would be foolish to expect no surprises. They point out that the Y2K situation is one for which there is no precedent and the task of finding all non-compliant computer chips in the interdependent petroleum and electricity industries is mammoth. Enron Corp. (ENE.N), a major U.S. petroleum company and pipeline operator, is among the companies unsure of what the New Year will bring. Despite their best efforts to upgrade their ""mission critical"" systems -- those that are essential to their business -- the company says ""there is no assurance that (our Y2K) plan will succeed in accomplishing its purposes or that unforseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the plan that would materially and adversely affect Enron."" Enron made the statement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said that neither it nor utilities and outside entities on which the company depends are likely to find and replace all non-compliant computer chips which could lead to what the company calls a ""cascading effect"" of system failures. ""The problem is not, and will not be, unique to Enron,"" the company added. Though Enron has not announced any precautionary Y2K shutdowns, a number of other major U.S. pipeline operators have. For example the Colonial Pipeline, the largest in the nation, plans an eight-hour shutdown starting on New Year's Eve. Explorer Pipeline, the second largest, plans a 20-hour shutdown before the rollover into the new year. The pipelines together supply nearly three million gallons of gasoline and other fuels per day between Houston, New York and Chicago. In preparation for the potential pipeline disruptions, as well as an expected buy up of fuel by nervous consumers, retail gasoline operators are planning to stock up an extra seven days of gasoline supplies to their normal 30 day inventories, according to industry and government officials. The planned inventory build could also guard against any potential disruptions at U.S. refineries, which produce the gasoline. By most accounts, refiners have put in the greatest amount of effort to iron out Y2K problems. According to Weiss Rating Co., the majority of large U.S. oil refining companies, like Exxon Corp (XON.N) and Mobil Corp. (MOB.N), are either average or above average in their adherance to Y2K plans mapped out more than a year ago, and only a handful, like Chevron Corp (CHV.N) and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp (UDS.N), are rated below average. ""While pipelines appear the more laggard group in the energy industry, refiners seem to be the more prepared,"" said Dr. Weiss. ""Over all, the energy sector appears to be taking the Y2K problem seriously - but that is no guarantee that the New Year will be a non-event."" According to reports by the American Petroleum Institute (API), the Natural Gas Association and other industry trade groups, nearly 100 percent of the nation's refiners, retailers, and pipeline operators will be ready for the year 2000 turnover, which comes in less than two months, by having Y2K proof systems in place and contingency plans if they break down.

A higher bid was submitted prior to Wednesday's 1 p.m. MST     deadline in a four-day open season, a pipeline spokesman said. However, the original     negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and retain the capacity.      The new bid was for $38 million over one year starting Jan. 1, about $8 million more than     the amount in Friday's announcement ($30 million). One source called it ""ridiculous"" that     someone was willing to pay so much for the space, given that on a mark-to-market basis     the capacity is worth only about $20-25 million.      Late last week some sources speculated that Duke Energy was the recipient of next     year's package given its large power generation holdings in California. A marketer     yesterday said he believed Dynegy upped the ante. ""Rather than go through all the     hassles they [Dynegy] had at FERC with the 1998-99 package, they let someone else do     all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid. That way no one can     complain that the procedure was tainted. After all, Dynegy has quite a few power plants     in California to keep fueled, and all of their current FT on El Paso expires at the end of     this year. Of course, they still could be thwarted if the original negotiated customer     matches their bid. It may all sound kind of Machiavellian but sort of makes sense."" Other     sources heavily discounted the chances of Dynegy being the new high bidder, pointing out     that the company made significantly less than expected this year because San     Juan/border basis differentials narrowed significantly. A Dynegy source indicated that the     company was involved in the bidding and lost to Duke in the first round.      Regardless of what happens next year, a marketer noted that the Southern California     border/San Juan basis spread continues to compress as SoCal Gas withdraws from     storage and east-of-California utilities exercise their peaking contracts because of cold     weather in the Rockies and elsewhere in the West. From a December index spread of 29     cents, the border/basin gap was down to about 18 cents Wednesday, she said.",kimberly.watson@enron.com,vince.kaminski@enron.com,X-To: Vince J Kaminski,X-cc: ,Intelligence: El Paso Capacity--Someone has Upped the Ante But,X-bcc: ,1999-12-16 09:02:00-08:00

JamesOn Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.  I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that  FJ did not act in good faith in ""expeditiously and fairly evaluating"" all of Enron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that commodity deals were never the ""intent"" of the Alliance as outlined in the ""Objectives of the Parties.""  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement to do commodity deals.Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of ""substantial assets"" as it related to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us because that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas consumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before informing us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance partners treat each other. I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the situation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to continue with it ""as is.""  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to their counsel Greg Chaffee.Next Steps:I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our case to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to do it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving ""bad faith"".  I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with the entire project list and the various ""reasons"" FJ chose not to do the projects.Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.  The parties are to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the mediator.  Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take place anytime between now and November 10.Let me know if you have questions.",richard.sanders@enron.com,skusin@susmangodfrey.com,,,Meeting with Ft.

For the time being, we are going to work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..Eden - Siderca - Enron DealEden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 /Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the following structure:Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during the term of the agreement.Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the agreement.Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot prices.Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and Ithought about two options:Dummy Option or,Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basisI am attaching a slide were the transaction is described.

Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand==20its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron==20Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function==20will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=gy=20commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=es=20but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=als,=20plastics and refined products risk management capability.

CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical==20Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,==20execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction==20with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of==20which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This==20dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service==20and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to==20the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and==20Western Coverage/Origination Groups.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 12/17/99=2003:01 PM ---------------------------  =20=09Enron North America Corp.=09=09From:  Enron NA Office of the Chairman                           12/16/9=9=2001:15 AM=09To: All Enron North Americacc: =20Subject: Organizational ChangesTo:  Enron North America Corp.From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin HannonIn July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=,=20and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the==20corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=e=20following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the==20Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.1) Coverage/Origination:To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product==20technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated==20under the leadership of Dave Delainey :a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,==20co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a==20broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=d=20mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,==20textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.Downstream Coverage/OriginationAs energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=t=20the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both==20ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand==20its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron==20Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function==20will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=gy=20commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=es=20but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=als,=20plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional==20capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels==20groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper==20will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three==20sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage==20activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=or=20the provision of innovative=20products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=n=20of paper risk management products;b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=o=20lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20chemicals and refined products industries;c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers==20Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead= the=20coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=he=20provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=s=20and glass manufacturing industries.Midstream Coverage/Originationa) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=n=20energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern==20Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=s=20group;b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =on=20energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=y=20will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the==20leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=s;c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=ocus on=20the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=hant=20power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked ==20Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will==20continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20Interconnect;d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=ing=20opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=e=20asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of==20Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join==20this newly formed business.2) Commercial Transactions:=20The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of==20transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=ecuting=20transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity==20of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical==20Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,==20execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction==20with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of==20which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This==20dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service==20and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to==20the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and==20Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy==20Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of==20Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today==20from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20origination.b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=ial=20origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is==20established.

Please review the revised discount letter which includes the following revisions:1) Clarification of Shipper's alternate rights at discount rate.2) Deletion of paragraph granting NMNG the ability to change monthly MAXDTQ quantities subject to a floor level.  (Tariff already provides this ability subject to mutual agreement of Shipper and TW).3) Addition of language which waives Shipper's ROFR rights.  4)  Addition of language which would allow TW to apply a possible additional future surcharge if TW were to file for authorization to recover Y2K costs through a new surcharge.In this particular discount letter I did not include language which allows TW the ability to retain capacity release revenues above the discount rate as this issue was not a part of the original negotiations. However, this language as well as the language overviewed above in 1), 3) and 4) will most likely be adopted as ""standard"" discount letter language in the future.Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.All officer approval will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential Level Approval",drew.fossum@enron.com,christine.stokes@enron.com,Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit,"Bcc: christine.stokes@enron.com, susan.scott@enron.com, steven.harris@enron.com, ",Re: REVISED NMNG Contract Approval Request,"	mary.miller@enron.com, glen.hass@enron.com, mary.darveaux@enron.com, ",2000-01-27 02:25:00-08:00

"X-FileName: mtaylor.nsfFurther to recent correspondence on this subject:""Killing"" EnronOnline deals has always been against policy, for a number of reasons, including the need to demonstrate to customers that this is a binding way to do deals and also to provide an auditable process to auditors who may be sceptical of an online transaction system - i.e. we need to show that clicking on the screen  results in a deal which results in an invoice every time.In the same way that it is rare to conclude a transaction by telephone with a trader and then attempt to ""back out"", we must ensure it is a rare event on EnronOnline. Deals can only be terminated under special circumstances, which must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the legal department in consultation with Credit and EnronOnline commercial staff and covered with a special contract entered into with the Counterparty.In all other circumstances, ""undoing"" a deal is at the discretion of the trader and is most easily accomplished by an OTC transaction which reverses the volume, price and payment impact, thus addressing most of the concerns raised below.Dave 		Brent A Price03/08/2000 09:02 AMTo: Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Feedback on EOL killed deals processI find it difficult to believe we would even be considering the use of OTC trades to effectively ""kill"" another deal.  The points Kathryn raise below are good ones.  How often do deals need to be terminated?  Unless that number is substantial (and I would hope it is not), why the opposition to executing a termination agreement with the counterparty and resolving the problem in the cleanest manner?---------------------- Forwarded by Brent A Price/HOU/ECT on 03/08/2000 08:57 AM ---------------------------	Kathryn Cordes	03/07/2000 10:53 AM	To: Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Feedback on EOL killed deals processSheri:Last week you provided me with the options for a process that you and Louise were working on for killed deals.  The 2 options for killed deals were 1.  the counterparty would call and execute an OTC to back out the deal (the opposite of whatever he transacted on line) and  2. Enron would execute to the counterparty a termination agreement per deal the counterparty wanted to back out.  My concerns for the first option are:1.  This potentially would not create a true net effect-  timing from the EOL trade and the phone call to execute the OTC could have price differences2.  The confirmation process is impacted, would have to generate 2 confirms, one for each side of the trade3.  Logistics would still have to nom and schedule for delivery both deals, may not be even volumes 4.  Settlements will see both invoices, again due to possible price and volume changes, will not be even netting The termination agreement would be the easiest process for the back office teams and would minimize the downstream effects to these processes.  The execution of termination agreements would be the strongest way to minimize our exposure to these deals since we have the Electronic Transaction Agreement in addition to the contract that governs the confirmation with the counterparty in place.   I know that commercial has a preference to option one but I want to make sure that all the issues are thought through with the possible impacts to the operations raised.  I've asked Scott Mills to explore Sitara for possible lock down of EOL deals after validation to ensure that there is tighter control over the deals for further exposure to potential modifications or kills.  Scott has indicated that the lock down of critical fields would be a big system change, but has agreed to review this and determine exactly what the IT estimates would be.  After we look at the Sitara requirements to support this change I will provide additional feedback.

For the first quarter of 2000 (and thereafter) Enron Corp. in  seriously contemplating disclosing in press releases, EOL volumes and revenues separate from traditional volumes and revenues.  They need to be able to get these numbers out of our regular accounting records.  The numbers that the EOL team calculates out of their systems (which is not a financial system) can be used to verify that the accounting numbers are being extracted correctly.Currently for ENA,  the EOL trade system feeds Sitara (deal capture) and passes over an EOL deal number.  Sitara assigns it's own deal number but passes both numbers when it feeds our settlement & logistics system (Unify).  Unify currently feeds our general ledger but it is not set up to book based upon the EOL  tag, we are designing that into our SAP design.  In the meantime, we will query Unify and extract the portion of Unify revenues and volumes that are EOL.  We will then book  a reclass into Hyperion to separate EOL revenues from traditional revenues.    We are currently using numbers provided by Bob Shults for 1999 to verify that everything is working correctly.  We are finding valid timing differences due to assumptions that Bob is making.Unfortunately, a few of the products that are being traded or will be traded on EOL do not feed into settlement systems like Unify but rather are invoiced manually.  We are having to identify a way to accurately capture those numbers as well, so that they can also be reclassified in Hyperion. This project has a pretty short fuse as there is much outside interest in EOL and thus a  great need to be able to accurately calculate sales revenues and sales volumes.Please call me with any questions that you have and keep me updated  on your progress.Jason Barra01/24/2000 06:33 AMTo: Georgeanne Hodges/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donnah Blake/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: EOL RevenuesHi Georgeanne,Donnah mentioned that Bob Shults has the statistical information you required for London EOL transactions but you require more supporting documentation to back them up.Would you be able to send me the reports and let me know the information you are looking for.

Some things to consider:Project Sally - allocate to Gas Network DevelopmentProject Hurricane - allocate to ???? - (I have a call into Jim Coffey)Denver Business - allocate to Rocky Mountain Asset OriginationsIf you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them, either call me, Jackie Nelson or Jim Coffey.One other thing to note:  The Network Trading group will be further broken down into 2 groups:  Trading (Tom Martin and Jim Schwieger) and Transportation (Ed Gottlob).  Although the attached worksheet does not include this breakdown, please include it in yours.I would like you allocations back to me no later than Thursday, 1/20 @ 3:00pm.

His company, LighTrade Inc., will spend $20 million-$25 million this year to install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth, or space on telecom lines, in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Miami, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and Washington, D.C. 	Bandwidth trading is growing, driven by increased demand by businesses for the Internet. In a report released last December, CIBC World Markets estimated that 20% of total bandwidth traffic, or $12 billion in revenues, could be traded in some manner within five years. 	Last week, Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG, news, msgs) announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit. 	LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites, known as pooling points, Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires. 	The points connect telecommunications carriers, allowing data to move from one network to another. They are installed in ""telecom hotels,"" buildings that house carrier facilities, and essentially consist of a Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU, news, msgs) bandwidth manager about the size of a tall, narrow refrigerator. 	Enron Broadband Services, a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles. It plans to build another in London this year. 	Last year, Enron Corp. proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized contract. It executed the first trade under the contract in December, buying space on a monthly basis on a New York-Los Angeles line from Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda. 	Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based technology research firm, has charged that Enron's ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in bandwidth trades. 	Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the bandwidth trading market get off the ground, said Stephen Kamman, a telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets. 	It's a ""very positive"" development for the bandwidth trading market, said Tom Gros, vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron. 	""This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for the open trading of bandwidth,"" Gros said. 	The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for years. Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate. Companies must start from scratch with each deal, negotiating price, quantity, length of contract and quality of service. 	In the past, deals have been long-term, sometimes as long as 20 years. But with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining 15%-20% a year, such terms are less attractive. 	Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth trading organization, an independent body that will decide on standard terms and conditions for trading. Two groups in London and one in the United States are vying to form such a group. 	LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic, Pierson said. Long-range plans call for the company to have sites in the 50 U.S. cities that develop the most traffic. 	But the company's pace building a network of points will depend on how quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading bandwidth as a commodity. 	LighTrade wants to install points in Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Memphis and Phoenix in 2001, Pierson said. It is eyeing a move into international markets as early as next year, if the market will support it. Western Europe is a likely starting point, with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites. 	Eventually, LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo and Osaka. 	The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies. 	In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its bandwidth managers, LighTrade has another connection to the high-tech company. William Plunkett, a senior vice president at Lucent, is on LighTrade's board of directors. Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would invest in his company. 	LighTrade isn't Pierson's first startup company. The telecommunications attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom (ARTT, news, msgs), a NASDAQ-traded company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. That company now has market capitalization of $800 million. 	Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three major telecommunications carriers, he said. He wouldn't identify the companies. He said he doesn't know of any competitors building pooling points, but he expects others to enter the market. 	He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop pooling points because they don't know how quickly the market will develop, he said. 	""But I wouldn't be in it if ... I did not think this would be a very significant economic return,"" Pierson said. 	-By Michael Rieke 1-713-547-9207 michael.rieke@dowjones.com",scott.bolton@enron.com,"sue.nord@enron.com, susan.landwehr@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, ",Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit,X-From: Scott Bolton,"	marchris.robinson@enron.com, lisa.yoho@enron.com, ","X-To: Sue Nord, Susan M Landwehr, Jeff Dasovich, Marchris Robinson, Lisa Yoho, Aleck Dadson, dlassere@enron.com, Tracy McLaughlin",2000-02-14 03:46:00-08:00

It's a ""very positive"" development for the bandwidth trading market, said Tom Gros, vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron. 	""This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for the open trading of bandwidth,"" Gros said. 	The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for years. Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate. Companies must start from scratch with each deal, negotiating price, quantity, length of contract and quality of service. 	In the past, deals have been long-term, sometimes as long as 20 years. But with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining 15%-20% a year, such terms are less attractive. 	Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth trading organization, an independent body that will decide on standard terms and conditions for trading. Two groups in London and one in the United States are vying to form such a group. 	LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic, Pierson said. Long-range plans call for the company to have sites in the 50 U.S. cities that develop the most traffic. 	But the company's pace building a network of points will depend on how quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading bandwidth as a commodity. 	LighTrade wants to install points in Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Memphis and Phoenix in 2001, Pierson said. It is eyeing a move into international markets as early as next year, if the market will support it. Western Europe is a likely starting point, with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites. 	Eventually, LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo and Osaka. 	The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies. 	In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its bandwidth managers, LighTrade has another connection to the high-tech company. William Plunkett, a senior vice president at Lucent, is on LighTrade's board of directors. Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would invest in his company. 	LighTrade isn't Pierson's first startup company. The telecommunications attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom (ARTT, news, msgs), a NASDAQ-traded company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. That company now has market capitalization of $800 million. 	Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three major telecommunications carriers, he said. He wouldn't identify the companies. He said he doesn't know of any competitors building pooling points, but he expects others to enter the market. 	He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop pooling points because they don't know how quickly the market will develop, he said. 	""But I wouldn't be in it if ... I did not think this would be a very significant economic return,"" Pierson said. 	-By Michael Rieke 1-713-547-9207 michael.rieke@dowjones.com",scott.bolton@enron.com,"sue.nord@enron.com, susan.landwehr@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, ",Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit,X-From: Scott Bolton,"	marchris.robinson@enron.com, lisa.yoho@enron.com, ","X-To: Sue Nord, Susan M Landwehr, Jeff Dasovich, Marchris Robinson, Lisa Yoho, Aleck Dadson, dlassere@enron.com, Tracy McLaughlin",2000-02-14 03:46:00-08:00

The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of $2,375,000 PER DAY.  I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.  Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what alternative damages may be offered.  Due to the unusual size of the penalty relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.  The charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.  I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 years.

He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but simplywants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply ask Vince's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price movements.   This wouldbe much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market (although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the ships because they will be treated as leases).JohnJohn---------------------- Forwarded by John Sherriff/LON/ECT on 22/05/2000 19:05 ---------------------------Joe Gold22/05/2000 18:58To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Exmar Purchase DecisionJohn,After spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil groups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.  I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners) have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million cost of this vessel.   Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.  2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plant's time line and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million     Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  millionI would do it.I will leave the rest to you.Joe",rick.buy@enron.com,"vince.kaminski@enron.com, ted.murphy@enron.com, david.gorte@enron.com, ","X-To: Vince J Kaminski, Ted Murphy, David Gorte, Vladimir Gorny",X-cc: ,	vladimir.gorny@enron.com,X-bcc: ,2000-05-22 06:35:00-07:00

I will follow-up to make sure we capture the one exception to the Policy and Standard that surfaced (Local Admin Rights on the laptop for development activity). IRM/Roberto Deleon will facilitate with a Risk Acceptance Request form.

"Recommendations:As the General Manager of the PERC/Enron Joint Power Development Program, Enron hereby submits its recommendations to the Management Committee for their consideration regarding the pending Torrence south parcel land acquisition decision.After reviewing the relevant commercial, legal and environmental issues with the respective Project Managers and development personnel, Enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken:1.  PERC should notify Peoples Gas, Light & Coke (PGL) on 6/16/00 that PERC does not intend to assume the role of Buyer as provided for in the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000. 2.  Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000 and PGL proceeds to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing, PERC and Enron should continue their due diligence and development activities on the Torrence south parcel.  Upon establishment of a proposed budget and schedule, these activities should be focused on achieving the goals of minimizing out-of-pocket development expenses and implementing prudent risk mitigation strategies on behalf of PERC and Enron.3.  Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000 and PGL plans to proceed to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing, PERC and PGL should immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the ICC approval of any future transfer (sale,lease, or alternative structure) of the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.Other Issues/Risks:1.  This recommendation is based upon the belief that although the Torrence south parcel does hold potential value to PERC and Enron as a project development site, the overall viability and risk/reward profile of the commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized.  The potential sources of value associated with this site are listed below: a. The site/project currently hold a priority position in the ComEd interconnection queue. b. The site (in combination with the Calumet project) captures the majority of available interconnection capability (500-600 MW) in the Calumet region of the ComEd system.  This would force competing IPP projects (i.e. Wizvest) to bear the financial burden of ComEd system upgrade costs. c. The site (in combination with the Calumet project) represents an integral component of developing a commercial solution to the Mission Energy/ComEd 500 MW ""in-city"" regulatory obligation to the city of the Chicago. d. The site represents one of the unique in-city sites capable of supporting a power project from a zoning, fuel supply, and transmission perspective.The factors contributing to the recommendation for PERC and Enron not to proceed to closing on 6/26/00 are listed below: a. The existence of known environmental contamination and the liabilities associated with entering the chain of title on the Torrence south parcel. b. The indemnification language contained within the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000. c. The incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity associated with the Torrence south parcel. d. PERC and Enron's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while further developing the commercial development opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an ICC-approved land transfer from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.2.  It is PERC and Enron's understanding that PGL plans to proceed to the closing on 6/26/00 and assume the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000.  3.  The south parcel represents a potential power plant development project site upon which PERC and Enron will continue to conduct due diligence and development activities.  The site is currently being evaluated as a candidate for a 6 x LM 6000 facility with either an '01 or '02 in-service date.4.  PERC and Enron have decided that it would not be prudent for either of their respective organizations to assume any form of environmental liability associated with the Torrence south parcel. PERC and Enron shall work to develop risk mitigation strategies including land options, environmental indemnifications, and other structures which protect their respective assets and the overall economic viability of a development project on the Torrence south parcel.5.  A potential risk associated with the above recommendations is that the time required to complete the ICC approval process necessary to transfer the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.  PERC development personnel have estimated that the ICC approval process could require up to 6 months (The transfer of the Calumet parcel was ""fast-tracked"" and took 3 months to achieve ICC approval).  This risk could impact the viability of an '01 in-service date for a Torrence Power LLC development project.  PERC and Enron will work to minimize the impact of this risk.6.

"X-bcc: X-Folder: \Sally_Beck_Jun2001\Notes Folders\Egm\Hall, toddX-Origin: Beck-SX-FileName: sbeck.nsfTed,Question 1)  The investments in CALME and APACHI are booked on an accrual basis.  I have had several meetings with Commercial and Accounting   representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are effectively reinvested back into the Assets.  Therefore, the   Market Values that are reflected on the MPR are actually Book Values.  The Book Values are typically adjusted the last week of the month   and are 1 month behind as the Internation groups wait until the GL is closed before communicating the updated values.Question 2)  Thanks for the heads-up on India.  I spoke with Sheila Glover and we are now aware of the details behind Rediff.com.  We need to ensure   that these positions are not accounted for on the DPR by India so that we do not double-report the P&L.  The long-term solution is to   establish a communication line for future investments.  Between Sheila, Donna Lowry, and I we can develop a plan.  Question 3)  The 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by Jeff Kinneman for Jim Easter.  During our last conversation, Jim told Jeff that these   are Strategic investments and should not be reflected on the MPR.There is still some uncertainty/confusion as to when an investment is classified as Merchant.  We could insist that all publically traded investments not included in the Equity books would qualify.  Having said that, I would like to know if the Gas Authority of India, Ltd (GAIL) and Europe's investment in MG are considered to be Merchant investments.I will be on vacation this Friday and all of next week so please include David Maxwell on any responses.  David and I will stay in touch so as to make adjustments as needed.Thanks,Todd   From:  Ted Murphy                                                             06/22/2000 03:07 PM				                           	To: D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick Buy Subject: Re: MPR for 6/20/00  Mr. Hall,I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the following questions: 1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM and they show no p&l for the year  Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums and commodity prices? 2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).  Where does this show up? 3) There are several bonds (publicly traded, registrered securities, housed in our Prime Broker accounts) owned by various Enron entities  that I do not believe are on the DPR.  Shouldn't they be?

There will be no slippage.  Consequently, the timetable we discussed will hold.  Also seems that Lay and Skilling both want Enron to be featured in the rollout presentation.2) Lockhart wants testimonials from people in TX, PA, and a state of my choosing.  I choose CA and Jesse Knight.  After conferring with Steve Montovano, we've agreed it should be Chick Tulli.  I am going tomorrow to Dallas to solicit Steve Wolens, the TX House bill sponsor who chastised me so roundly for Enron's ""pullout"" from CA.  I also hope to get a meeting with Pat Wood (TX PUC chair) next Monday.3) I plan to make visits to TX, CA, PA, NJ, NY, OH, and CT before the May 1 rollout.  Ideally, I will have Enron people with me.4) Mark Manly feels strongly, as do I, that Susan and Thom should be at these meetings.Hope to see you next week.",janine.migden@enron.com,thomas.reichelderfer@enron.com,Mime-Version: 1.0,Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii,Re: follow up to yesterday's meeting,Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit,2000-04-19 04:03:00-07:00

ProjectThe project's consultant, George Briden, of Snake Hill Energy, called me today to say that Caithness Corp. has decided to move forward with plans for the Big Sandy, LLC. Project.  To refresh your memory, the project is a proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW's pipeline along Highway 93, about 2 miles outside of Wickieup, Arizona.  I've attached a simple bitmap below (click on it and hit ""view"") indicating the location of the project relative to Transwestern's facilities.  Ultimately, the project would be built for approx. 1,000 MW of generation in two phases.  Phase 1 will burn approx. 80,000 Dth/d, and phase 2 will burn an additional 120,000 Dth/d.  Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 2002, with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2, 2001.Caithness Corp., based in New York, is a privately held company with diverse interests including geothermal (renewable) electric generation facilities (Coso Plant) in California.  George reported that Caithness would like for Transwestern to build, own and operate the plant with facility costs (current estimate, $20.3MM) to be amortized vis-a-vis a throughput/rate commitment.  Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso's system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever be completed.Obviously, we'll have to wade throught the legal/regulatory issues surrounding this deal structure, as well as the requisite credit assurances.  With respect to the former, I think if we view this pipeline ownership/operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be present.Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one sitting.Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time comes together.

There will be no slippage.  Consequently, the timetable we discussed will hold.  Also seems that Lay and Skilling both want Enron to be featured in the rollout presentation.2) Lockhart wants testimonials from people in TX, PA, and a state of my choosing.  I choose CA and Jesse Knight.  After conferring with Steve Montovano, we've agreed it should be Chick Tulli.  I am going tomorrow to Dallas to solicit Steve Wolens, the TX House bill sponsor who chastised me so roundly for Enron's ""pullout"" from CA.  I also hope to get a meeting with Pat Wood (TX PUC chair) next Monday.3) I plan to make visits to TX, CA, PA, NJ, NY, OH, and CT before the May 1 rollout.  Ideally, I will have Enron people with me.4) Mark Manly feels strongly, as do I, that Susan and Thom should be at these meetings.Hope to see you next week.",janine.migden@enron.com,thomas.reichelderfer@enron.com,Mime-Version: 1.0,Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii,Re: follow up to yesterday's meeting,Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit,2000-04-19 04:03:00-07:00

El Paso recommends bemade to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment toparties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first attachmentis a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled ""Firm Pipeline Capacity into SouthernCalifornia"" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate capacity onEl Paso at Topock, shown in the col. ""Incoming Interstate Capacity,"" by replacingthe incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gaswhich is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct figure,  2080MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from thecol. ""Total Take-away Capacity"" since this capacity is not firm capacity availableto California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by thesechanges; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Pasohave existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGastotaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topockand clearly creates a ""mismatch""; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to thephysical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas atWheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the meteringis currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematicsintended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points andinterconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physicalinterconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurateimpression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of severalseparate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that severalinterconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Pasounderstands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses toAdministrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning""mismatches"" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGasreceipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose SoCalGasfiling an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the changesand additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.

El Paso recommends bemade to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment toparties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first attachmentis a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled ""Firm Pipeline Capacity into SouthernCalifornia"" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate capacity onEl Paso at Topock, shown in the col. ""Incoming Interstate Capacity,"" by replacingthe incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gaswhich is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct figure,  2080MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from thecol. ""Total Take-away Capacity"" since this capacity is not firm capacity availableto California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by thesechanges; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Pasohave existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGastotaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topockand clearly creates a ""mismatch""; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to thephysical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas atWheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the meteringis currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematicsintended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points andinterconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physicalinterconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurateimpression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of severalseparate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that severalinterconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Pasounderstands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses toAdministrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning""mismatches"" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGasreceipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose SoCalGasfiling an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the changesand additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.

I had asked Dan to come up with a number they would think appropriate for terminating the trade.  I also discussed the deal with their relationship officer Robert Furst so they are all engaged.  I think Dan is simply trying to elicit a higher first bid from us without him doing any work or potentially leaving any money on the table since it is us that wants to unwind the trade.I have Rogers Herndon pulling some information on how much the position has moved since we did the deal.  I also have him working through what we would have done if we owned the deal i.e. how much gas basis risk we would have mitigated and what the value would be now as well and any other hedges we would have put on and the value of them now.  This will give us information to either negotiate or at least get a better picture of what a better offer should be.  I have also notified Elizabeth Sager, our lawyer, to dig back in and get back up to speed on the deal to prepare to discuss it.  As I see it our options are: Option 1:  NegotiateRogers/Kevin/Myself go to NY and negotiate/highlight the risks in the deal with MLOption 2: Relationship PlayEither myself or Cliff start leaning on the relationship people at ML to force ML into a more realistic first offer.

At that time, a fee ofapproximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction.Since the execution of the trade, Merrill Lynch has had to manage the riskassociated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basisrisks that Merrill Lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate theaccounting treatment desired by Enron as part of the transaction.Additionally, as I am sure that you and your traders are aware, the positionhas considerably appreciated in value since trade execution.Even with these factors, Merrill Lynch is prepared to accommodate Enron'srequest to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million.This fee encompasses the original fee that Enron had agreed to pay toMerrill Lynch and does not take into consideration any of Merrill Lynch'shedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate tocontact me.Regards, as always.Dan Gordon",david.delainey@enron.com,rodney.malcolm@enron.com,,,Merrill Lynch Offer - Termination of Midwest Peaking Trade,\David_Delainey_Dec2000\Notes Folders\Discussion threads,2000-06-01 07:56:00-07:00

As a result of this decision, Enron has also made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our return in this industry.One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position.We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin Presto were available to join us as well.

This is a listing of what's been going on.            TIME PDHDATE     COMMODITY BOOK GIVEN TO TRADER   SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION8/25/00 ENPOWER - WEST  7:05    Original    West cash flows did not look right.  Valerie left voice mail         late Thursday night stating not to treat the $18M gain as          final.  She indicated that Lavorato was going to review the         cash flows  this morning and she will let us know the final          number at that time.  These cashflows created a $19,000         PV01 affect.              7:45    Re-ran w/old West CF  After consulting with Pushkar, we replaced  the new west              cash flows with prior days so hedging could begin.    10:15   Final    Spoke with Monica Lande at 9:30am and she stated that the             original cash flows received were real. We then had to          bring the original cash flows back and re-do the PDH          reports.8/28/00 refer to email sent by Sheila on this day.8/29/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:35     Cash flows received from the UK book looked really weird.          The $38M cash flow curve change created a 15,000 PV01         affect.  We contacted Guy Freshwater regarding.  He         indicated that per Mark Fondren, the book was officialized          Monday, on Friday since Monday was a Holiday for their          Office.  We backed out the new cash flow, and then substituted         the old ones.8/30/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:30  Original    The same thing happened as 8/29/00.  The book was not officialized      7:45  Final    on 8/29, therefore we received the same incorrect cash flows.  We again         substituted these cash flows with those received on 8/25/00.  I talked with         Mark Fondren and he indicated that the book has now been officialized.         (In the past we have not had issues with the UK commodity Books in the          ERMS system. )8/31/00 ENPOWER - WEST 7:20  Original    Cash flows received for west created a 14,000 PV01 affect.  We contacted    8:00  Final    Monica Lande and she informed us that there was a $14 M loss in their book,          but $6 M was not real.  We asked for a cash flow strip for the incorrect flows, but          she was not able to provide it.  Therefore, we used the previous day's cash         flows.  After the 7:20 PDH report, the system started running slow, therefore         it took even longer to produce a revised report.",sheila.glover@enron.com,"sally.beck@enron.com, brent.price@enron.com",X-From: Sheila Glover,"X-To: Sally Beck, Brent A Price",Summary of Cash Flow Events,X-cc: Gary Hickerson,2000-08-31 04:52:00-07:00

The question that we need someguidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do withthe results.  There are at least two levels that we could look ateffectively. 1.  Fairly quickly, a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of'98 when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest.  It would need tofocus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today(along with the midwest) and also get a glimmer on (rumor picked up here)the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers.  The conclusion from '98was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals forboth generation additions and for DSM investments (load response).Presumably this would carry forward to a 2000 study. 2.  A more careful look at the same areas described above but morefocused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers.  WEcovered this only in a cursory fashion in '98.  Here we would need to do twothings.  The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folksunderstand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the otherbilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions (the lesson of'98)not all kWh.  This is different from price spikes in the ""pool markets""where they set the price for all kWh.  The second point is to see that thereis an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge, i.e. thatyou could ""look on EOL"" and buy forward a 7x24 for the summer, say, and paya market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis byabsorbing it in a 3 month contract. The ""price signal for investment""conclusion would carry forward as above.What do you think the level of interest / need is and how quickly does heneed some or all of the answers?This is a good time for TCA to tackle this.  We have (or had) a quiet momentfor both Fagan and Rao who are the two experts on data development andanalysis from published sources.Christi, let's talk in the morning so I can scope an RCR.Thank you.Richard-----Original Message-----From: Christi L Nicolay [mailto:Christi.L.Nicolay@enron.com]Sent: Tuesday, July 18, 2000 5:17 PMTo: James D SteffesCc: tabors@tca-us.com; Joe Hartsoe; Richard Shapiro; Steven J Kean; RobBradleySubject: Re: Dan Larcamp requestThanks, Jim--Dan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problemsareand to educate his staff.  In that regard, we have offered to have some ofhisstaff down to use some of Enron's tools.  He was specifically asking for thedata below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps.  I didn't get afeelingthat he would use the data to say that everything is fine.  In fact, we tookhimthrough some parking examples and he asked that we hold a ""seminar"" typeactivity for some of his senior staffers.  He is in the process of bringingonsome staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues, etc.  He was veryfamiliar with the other problems on the grid.He also asked Kevin why Enron doesn't want LMP everywhere because with ourstaffing we can run over everyone else.  Kevin told him that then there isnomarket liquidity and we can't trade with ourselves.  As it is now, there areless than 10 big players due to the transmission risk.  We explained indetailwhat happens in the ""Into"" Markets and why it is so difficult to deal withtransmission/physical risk.  Kevin said that even the big bank players, likeMorgan Stanley, usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation sotheydo not have to take transmission risk.  Dan L., having come from gas,understoodthe liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin.  (He sat down inKevin's chair and looked at pricing on EOL.)Overall, it was a very positive meeting.  Kevin was impressed that Dan L.reallyunderstood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something, but neededhelpin educating his people.James D Steffes@EES07/18/2000 04:00 PMTo:   Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   tabors@tca-us.com@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron@ECT, Richard      Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Rob      Bradley/Corp/Enron@ENRONSubject:  Re: Dan Larcamp request  (Document link: Christi L Nicolay)Christi, etal --I don't disagree with this analysis, but the drive for competitivegeneration isnot simply related to the short term benefits (one year total energy billversusnext year total energy bill).

"Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.These guys add no value and they are killing me!RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 07:14 PM ---------------------------David W Delainey09/26/2000 07:12 PMTo: Dick Westfahl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Larry L Izzo/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:  Subject: Las Vegas CoGenGuys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks.Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 07:01 PM ---------------------------Dick Westfahl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT09/26/2000 09:30 AMTo: Dave Delaineycc: Larry L Izzo/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Las Vegas CoGenDave:See attached memo.

"Jeff,Sorry I've been hard to get a hold of... we held a workshop today to talk about our proposed Transport Options program.  I found a copy of what I'd sent to you before.  I'll stand behind these numbers today as representing the dollar value of the risk Transwestern faced in the proceeding.  What's not clear from my original note is that these cost impacts were annual, and such impacts would continue year to year thereafter until conditions/circumstances changed.  I hope this is useful.---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron on 08/31/2000 05:25 PM ---------------------------Jeffery Fawcett03/06/2000 04:40 PMTo: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EEScc:  Subject: GIR proceeding-- Potential Financial Impact to TWJeff,You asked me to try to quantify the impact of Transwestern losing access rights to 200 MMcf/d of capacity at SoCal Needles as part of the GIR proceeding.  Unfortunately, it's not a precise science inasmuch as it depends on the shippers' reaction and/or retaliation to such circumstances.  As a baseline, Transwestern is almost fully subscribed under various term length contracts (and has been since 1998) to the California Border, including the 750 MMcf/d of capacity available at SoCal Needles.  In concept, under SFV rates, the majority of revenues would otherwise be realized by TW, notwithstanding the circumstance of TW shippers being denied full access to their primary delivery point.  In this ""best case,"" the loss to TW would be the commodity rates (theoretically, a wash, since they presumably represent the true variable cost of TW providing the service), and the revenue benefit associated with the fuel margin, calculated to be $5.8MM.If TW shippers took the position that TW was responsible, and therefore, accountable for their inability to consumate a portion of their transactions into SoCal Gas' system, then TW faces a ""more onerous case"" in which it loses the demand charge component of their contracts calculated to be $16.5MM.  Coupled with the aforementioned fuel margin, the total loss is $22.3MM. In the worst case, in addition to the actual damages or costs to TW's shippers described above, TW shippers may face performance penalties or other contractual damages involving their commodity sales to customers behind SoCal Gas.  Therfore, TW shippers may attempt to extract those same penalties and costs from TW.Realistically, I'd say that TW faces a loss somewhere between the best case and the more onerous case, maybe in the $12 - $15MM range.I hope this information is useful for purposes of your analysis.

Wayne cancelled that meeting later that same afternoon.  I spoke with him today in regarding the reasons for cancellation.  As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent ""game plan"" for going forward.The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday, October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs, construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001 commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.Wayne Duman is very involved in VEPCO's effort to develop an Interconnection Agreement consistent with FERC.  They are within days of completing this task--it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the ""boiler plate"" Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's ""to do list"" to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the Enron PPA.He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep Enron informed of the progress.In summary, VEPCO is doing the following:getting all stakeholders on the same page,finishing the Facility Study, andgetting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.Reagan",kay.mann@enron.com,christi.nicolay@enron.com,,,VEPCO Interconnect Discussions,\Kay_Mann_June2001_4\Notes Folders\'sent mail,2000-09-26 06:20:00-07:00

"X-Origin: LAY-KX-FileName: klay.nsfKen,I hope things are well with you.I've taken on in the last year of my 6 year term the regents' chairmanshipand so I am busy working on how to help further accelerate the good thingsthat have occurred since we brought Art and his team to Houston.  In thislight, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting thatthe Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth whichwe are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, basedon the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction ofthat, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be ahuge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as wemove to Tier One status.Since Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you orsomeone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, ifany, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron'sperspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helpingorganize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit thevalue of that asset.Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Best regards.Gary",rosenthal@heaneyrosenthal.com,klay@enron.com,"X-From: ""Gary Rosenthal"" <rosenthal@heaneyrosenthal.com>","X-To: ""Ken Lay"" <klay@enron.com>",UH bandwidth,"X-cc: ""Arthur K.

I landed in the research group as a summer associate at the end of June, straight from sunny Palo Alto, where I am pursuing a PhD in Management Science and Engineering.  Since my area of research is the performance evaluation and economic analysis of communication networks, Enron is ""the"" place to be: Enron Broadband Services has the first mover's advantage in this field, and nearly every decision requires an understanding of both data networks and financial mathematics. Enron has  most of the needed skills to succeed, and the right attitude. After two months here, I am more convinced than ever that the best is still to come.I am from Rome, Italy, where I have spent most of my life (my pre-columbian period, properly speaking). Italy is the nation known among Americans  for having invented the pasta alfredo and for having elected a porn star as a member of parliament. The former allegation is indeed false: pasta alfredo is quintessential american. About the latter, one of my dubious achievement is to have interviewed the aforementioned member of parliament about her political agenda, receiving predictably fuzzy answers.As many members of the research groups, my background is in Physics. I fell in love with Operation Research and Management Science while working for a large IT consulting firm in Italy, and wanted to learn more. I have been a student at Stanford University since then. Studying there has been a very enjoyable experience, and I am sorry I will have to leave it sometime soon.Management Science is not the only hobby in my life. I am an avid motorcyclist, and am a lifelong student of argentine tango.

Credit matrix and 2. Threshold amount Dear John,Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess this means US$15 million credit limit.  On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the ""Threshold Amount"" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on this?Thanks.Jane McBride	John Suttle@ECT	09/27/2000 12:39 AM				 To: Jonathan Whitehead/AP/Enron@ENRON		 cc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kevin Cordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E Pettersen/AP/Enron@Enron, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENTJonathan,One thing we might be able to propose is a ""Credit Matrix"" which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA).Rating (S&P)     Credit LineAA or above    $20MMBBB+ to AA-    $15MMBBB     $10MMBBB-     $7MMBB- to BB+    $5MMBelow BB-    $1MMThese terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality.What do you all think?JohnJonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PMTo: John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kevin Cordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E Pettersen/AP/Enron@Enron, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT  Sorry, Pressed send too early:John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA?Thanks,Jonathan	John Viverito	09/22/2000 12:04 PM				 To: John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECT		 cc: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@Enron@ECT, John Viverito/Corp/Enron@ENRON@ECT, Jonathan.Whitehead@enron.com, Kevin Cordesman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Morten E Pettersen/AP/Enron@Enron@ECT, Steven Kleege/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Bruce-Jones/LON/ECT@ECT		 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENTJohn-During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call.  IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this issue was ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.

It is not now, nor will it be in the future the audit department's responsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of the audit process.

This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach given his understanding of the project risks and economics.  The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park  with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 through Jan 31.We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.

The additional two LM6000's materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional equipment through West LB ASAP:6 stacks  $1,188,0003 Control Modules $375,0001 CEMS  $675,0004 230kv Breakers $340,000Total:   $2,578,000The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are minimal as follows:Now through November 1:    $257,800Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec Committe meeting in November.How does this sound to you?Regards,Chris",david.delainey@enron.com,christopher.calger@enron.com,,,PSCO,\David_Delainey_Dec2000\Notes Folders\'sent mail,2000-10-09 06:38:00-07:00

"X-Origin: Delainey-DX-FileName: ddelain.nsfChris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 11/20/2000 11:31 AM ---------------------------Christopher F Calger11/19/2000 01:35 PMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas SaleDave,We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    Kelemen is doing a great job.In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their original bid.Calpine - PastoriaEarly in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, and their bid assumed  ""market"" for the turbines.   While they are correct (the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  AES - PastoriaSame PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  CEC Process:On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that (i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to Enron for nothing! AES-Las VegasThey seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will know more this week and will update you when we know.

Rock did call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in a row in quick succcession.I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been able to load these into the test data bases.The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any time to convert these spreadsheets over.The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng directory.

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Companyexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20approximately$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=al3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=ipbetween Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 toprovide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20businessesin the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed onthe NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occurOct. 11.ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued theIPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=-upcompany that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rathermind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could openits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20followinga trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported bygrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=yI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=,TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantialoperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20profitability.""Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20""significant,""but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greetingthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that thesheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven upthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investmentsand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-upcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority ownerof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20importantacquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=lretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=ly285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eightstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customersduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anothercustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers havebeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by theT&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easilybuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming thereis a willing seller.Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferredits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesbut did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlierthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC hascome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer baseof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residentialcustomers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreatedfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make anymoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that EnronEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=gthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=alconsumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling powerto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=tiallymoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of itsretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=tsas it is the majority owner.I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablyon a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Lookingahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on thebright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, startingwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Otherkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxonand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably couldnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has beengolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being themajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approachin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customersthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secretweapon.But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competitionis not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=ia,which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitedStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have optedto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=ailmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able todo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on thetechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenuemanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, underwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=s.IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=.In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when theutility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer informationsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM haspartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Underan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS willbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under developmentby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT'sBanner CIS can handle over one million customers.

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Companyexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20approximately$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=al3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments.

It is rathermind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could openits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20followinga trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported bygrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=yI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=,TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantialoperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20profitability.""Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20""significant,""but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greetingthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that thesheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven upthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investmentsand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-upcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority ownerof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20importantacquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=lretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=ly285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eightstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customersduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anothercustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers havebeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by theT&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easilybuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming thereis a willing seller.Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferredits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesbut did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlierthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC hascome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer baseof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residentialcustomers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreatedfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make anymoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that EnronEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=gthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=alconsumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling powerto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=tiallymoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of itsretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=tsas it is the majority owner.I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablyon a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Lookingahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on thebright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, startingwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Otherkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxonand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably couldnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has beengolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being themajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approachin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customersthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secretweapon.But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competitionis not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=ia,which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitedStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have optedto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=ailmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able todo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on thetechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenuemanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, underwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=s.IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=.In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when theutility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer informationsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM haspartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Underan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS willbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under developmentby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT'sBanner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this willsurely limit TNPC's growth potential.Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20uncertaintiessurrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players inthe energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possibleexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain.

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Companyexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20approximately$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=al3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments.

TNPC's shares will be listed onthe NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occurOct. 11.ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued theIPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=-upcompany that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rathermind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could openits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20followinga trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported bygrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=yI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=,TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantialoperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20profitability.""Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20""significant,""but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greetingthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that thesheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven upthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investmentsand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-upcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority ownerof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20importantacquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=lretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=ly285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eightstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customersduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anothercustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers havebeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by theT&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easilybuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming thereis a willing seller.Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferredits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesbut did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlierthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC hascome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer baseof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residentialcustomers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreatedfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make anymoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that EnronEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=gthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=alconsumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling powerto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=tiallymoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of itsretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=tsas it is the majority owner.I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablyon a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Lookingahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on thebright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, startingwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Otherkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxonand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably couldnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has beengolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being themajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approachin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customersthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secretweapon.But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competitionis not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=ia,which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitedStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have optedto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=ailmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able todo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on thetechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenuemanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, underwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=s.IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=.In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when theutility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer informationsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM haspartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Underan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS willbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under developmentby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT'sBanner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this willsurely limit TNPC's growth potential.Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20uncertaintiessurrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players inthe energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possibleexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain.

Thanks.Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful information that can be used at the state PUC level, including information on the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute to lack of price caps following the summer 1998 price spikes; better preparation for summer 2000 through the use of forward contracts and transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from particular markets.On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years:Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests.While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints.The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures.Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports.RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology.Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services.  DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs.TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO.Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest.  Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."")Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity.Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance.  Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, there is evidence of discriminatory instances.Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs.There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies.In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information.The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication are needed.The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information.Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine competition.The reports are attached below. - southeast.pdf - midwest.pdf",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,robert.hemstock@enron.com,X-To: Robert Hemstock,X-cc: ,FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power,X-bcc: ,2000-11-15 08:20:00-08:00

TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO.Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest.  Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."")Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity.Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance.  Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, there is evidence of discriminatory instances.Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs.There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies.In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information.The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication are needed.The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information.Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC web site report dated 9/8/00)).

Vittorio Mincato,Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge offinalizingthe sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's realestate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by manyobserversof the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger withanother company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short listof merger prospects for Eni.ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger betweenEni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argumentin that direction.Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating inthe oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, andengineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70countriesand produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Acrossthe European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will representan arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionablyone of the Continent's leading champions.Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europeto, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the Continent'scompetitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inkeda deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4billioncubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start tothe opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said thatEni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italyby ""focusing on international markets.""One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percentstake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off thenorthern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undanand apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillioncubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorabledecisionis expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it istrying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recentlyconfirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a currentlevel of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both withinEurope and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of mergerstrategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, whichcould be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the factthat its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the firsthalf of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely consideredone of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather mergewith an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidationof the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only wayto remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the worldstage.Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiationswith Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as wasconfirmed when Mincato stated that any ""link-up with Repsol would not bea merger of equals."" French oil company TotalFina is also interested, butis preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and PhillipsPetroleum.It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oilcompanies,which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd thatEnron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably aworld player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Putsuccinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assetsin order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategiccontractual agreements.However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably couldnot find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America'sbiggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradingand distribution activities in particular-along with its electricityproduction,raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be goodcompliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companiesfirst appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based oninput from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is beingtargeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that anydeal with Enron is being studied.Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not evenmentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation ofEni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into newmarkets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese governmentbegan allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial andcommercialend-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, EnronJapan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. EnronJapan'sfirst offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices forcustomers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating againstits North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power stationin northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includingVivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interestin establishing operations in the country.Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access tocompaniesin the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the ""big catch"" of theJapanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that wouldmake the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for bothcompanies.As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seemslike a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni ismoving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, alongwith most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealingto Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni'ssubstantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its currentlock on the European market, must be very attractive.Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actuallymakes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company wouldbe the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of therumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it couldjust as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closelymay find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be thetarget for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continueto fly as Eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" Whetheror not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eniis lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in thevery near future.==============================================================SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need.

"X-FileName: klay.nsfKen, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 2000.On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.   3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.   a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer. I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these groups.   I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.

The call is scheduled for 11:30 CST and will last at least an hour, possibly more.  By way of background, ENE and CalPERS are 50/50 partners in JEDI II - which was created in December 1997.  JEDI II is a funding vehicle for Enron's energy related merchant investments.  Transactions of note are:  3.9% minority equity interest in EES, equity ownership in Quanta, 100% ownership of East Coast Power (since sold down to 51%), and participation in a number of E&P drilling partnerships and coal investments.  The commitment period was set to expire on December 31, 2000 - and was extended to March 31, 2001.   In addition, CalPERS invested $40 Million in The New Power Co prior to the IPO.   Andy and I are working with CalPERS to amend the current JEDI II partnership in order that we continue our successful relationship with CalPERS.  The Alternative Investment Management (AIM) staff that we work with are very supportive of Enron and we are looking at a number of opportunities to put their money to work in our businesses.  CalPERS hasn't provided any specific questions that they want answered.  My thoughts on how to structure the call is for Marty to spend some time talking about California, Enron's role there and our view of the situation.  Then, Richard could address the regulatory status in California.  I would expect this to be somewhat of a freeform conference call.  One area we may discuss is how Enron and CalPERS can team up on a California initiative.  The AIM staff is interested in discussing this particular point.  The following individuals from CalPERS senior staff will be on the call: Dan Szente, Chief Investment Officer Robert Aguallo, Chief Operating Officer Barry Gonder, Senior Investment Officer, AIM Rick Hayes, Senior Principal Investment Officer, AIM (primary Enron contact) Mark Anson, Senior Investment Officer, Public Equities Mary Cottrill, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Public Equities Lou Jug, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Real Estate Curtis Ishi, Senior Investment Officer, Fixed IncomePlease give me a call if you have any questions.

As for the purchase of the assets out of the financing facility, Kay knows the required documents from the Intergen deal.  There needs to be close coordination amongst all the internal groups to insure your deal closes timely and accurately.  Remember in your negotiations that the money from NorthWestern needs to be received into escrow a minimum of 5 Business Days before the closing date.  The financing requires the purchase notice (which is irrevocable so if Enron provides it and NorthWestern walks, the turbines are on Enron's balance sheet at 15% interest rate essentially) be provided to the banks at least 5 but not more than 15 Business Days prior to closing date for purchase from the financing vehicle.Thanks for the heads up. -----Original Message-----From:  Booth, Chris  Sent: Wednesday, March  7, 2001 9:53 AMTo: Bills, LisaCc: Mann, Kay; Jacoby, BenSubject: Re: FW: Blue Dog #2Lisa,Sorry, I should have included you in the initial distribution.Ben Jacoby and I are in negotiations with NorthWestern Corporation in a deal to place the two GE 7EA's (Blue Dog) turbines.

This transaction should be similar to the Intergen deal, with the exception that instead of moving two turbines out of the 24 LM 6000 master contract, we plan on assigning the entire Blue Dog contract to a LLC that Enron will own 100% at the time of transfer and then sell 80% to NorthWestern.I want to have the change order ready for execution once we come to terms with NorthWestern.

"For information purposes I am attaching a spreadsheet showing what the potential value of this transaction may be given various terms and volumes.

(""ABE"" - ""anybody but Enron"", being the primary reason we failed.)  The deal we were offering was the option to supply from the market in exchange for a 20% discount in the capacity payment.  At the time, we WERE going to shut down the QF and pay them more PV than they would have gotten by running, the ""grease"" coming from the relatively high O&M, which could be extinguished with the proposed structure.  This structure sounds like a strict option, but should still work great.  The ""grease"" in this case is the arbitrage between market price and QF operating cost.In the past, I have called John Fielder, VP Regulatory Affairs, when I want to talk about something strategic with SCE.  He was my fellow board member on the ISO board.  I could call him for you.

Basically, Enron would pay for the right to dispatch the QF so that their obligations to the utility could be met by either the plant or the market.  For that right, Enron would be able to pay for/absorb most of the past due receivables owed to the QF.  Several QF's have expressed interest, but the utility wont return calls.  We could not do this for the whole QF group, but we could do it for 500MW+, which could save everyone $200MM+ in past due receivables.

Revenue allocation:  I strongly recommend that we stay silent on this until after the recommended decision comes out.  I feel that our support could easily be the kiss of death to a particular proposal.  The bottom line is that our proposal works with any allocation method.  We can support the one that is accepted in the recommended decision or argue for another but I would hold off in this round.AgreeWhile some of the additions to rate design section seem to be along the lines of what we put in the record, both in direct and on cross, I think the free rider, CBL stuff is new and could be stricken, and may just make our stuff seem more complicated.  AgreeI have similar concerns about the alternate interim proposal in this brief, seems like it  includes lots of facts we did not put in our testimony.We did put the facts in in the response to data we filed with ALJ on monday.  If you are referring to ratios between on and off peak.PX credit based on market value -- the hearing examiner has no authority to address this issue so why put it in?  In a case like this with such a short time frame, decision makers who want to be diligent and read everything that is filed, will resent having to read stuff that is not germane to the issues at hand.  It is gratuitous and likely to aggravate her.I was responding to PGE testimony.  We at least should say - that the CPUC should not determine the outcome of this recommendation because it is outside of the scope of this hearing.  If you agree that it is outside the scope.

The premise is obviously preaching to the choir, and we (as I am sure others do as well) have a string of proposals starting with SDGEs in May or June that, if we melded their timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to thinking people.  However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and the reporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that we would like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could get some sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we be like the irritating kid who keeps saying ""I told you so"", so it does not matter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing the prices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of prices could not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would be there, partially revealed.)My vote:  if it does not hurt us (competitively, PR, etc.), if it is legal, and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a market based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore to restaurants near the CPUC......I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision to you guys.  Whatever you decide, is OK.PS - At the very least, we should feed our own proposals and their prices into this timeline.  Privately, we could show it to various parties on a case by case basis to advance our cause.

"X-bcc: X-Folder: \RHAYSLE (Non-Privileged)\Hayslett, Rod\Projects\Portland GeneralX-Origin: Hayslett-RX-FileName: RHAYSLE (Non-Privileged).pstAs a result of the termination of the Sierra transaction we are taking stepsto write off our capitalized investment costs associated with software systems(Peoplesoft) that we incurred to integrate PGE with Sierra Pacific. Specifically we spent $2.7 million on a material management system to allowsus to move from Enron's SAP system to Peoplesoft and  $.4 million on  systemsfor migration of our HR system to Peoplesoft.  (total $3.1 million)Here is what I would like to propose and would like to get your concurrenceand support for this plan.We previously informed Bob and Mark Lindsey that we want to reestablishEnron's overhead charges to PGE.  Kirk Stevens from PGE is working on thisproject to make it happen.  These charges did not occur in the first quarterand we believe we should pay for those costs for regulatory reasons (currentlypart of our approved revenue requirements).  What I would recommend is thatyou bill us for the total 1st quarter overhead allocations in April and at thesame time Enron would  provide us a credit for the cumulative incurred chargesof $3.1 million.  The net effect of this would be a small catch up payment byPGE for the overhead allocations as well as the ongoing payments for Apriloverheads.  This would get our books back on a consistent basis and would havea minimal impact on PGE and Enron's IBIT and net income.  This is becauseEnron did not assume any allocations to PGE during the first quarter.If you find this to be a workable proposal let me know and I will have KirkStevens work with Mark and Bob to implement the charges to the appropriateaccounts.  This will clean up our books on anything remaining from the Sierratransaction.Thanks for your attention to this matter.

"X-Origin: KITCHEN-LX-FileName: louise kitchen 2-7-02.pstLas Vegas:Allegheny's bid was strong but required a financing out for 45 days - unacceptable.  Black Hills' bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a $35MM gain for ENA ($10MM has to go to Calpers since they are an investor in LV 1).  They are going to their board Thursday and want to execute by early next week and close Aug 31.  We will try to get a higher bid from Northland this week ($40MM gain).  They will require a two-week financing out which they will secure with a $10MM non-refundable deposit.  If we sign with Northland, they can close in July.In either case, accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because Las Vegas is a fair market value investment.   RAC requires a DASH to sell an asset of this size - we will circulate on Wednesday or Thursday.One long shot deal we are proposing to Allegheny:  Tear up the existing 15 year toll backed by the Las Vegas project.  Enter into a 15 year firm energy sale from EPMI at Palo Verde.  The value of that deal may be in excess of $100MM since the market has fallen so much.  If we did that, we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost - this is achievable.  This would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval, but the value makes it worth exploring.AMPS:We continue to push Geneva Steel and Oregon Steel for permitting info.  West power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best.  Friday's curves suggested a value of $10MM vs a cost of $17MM.  An imperfect put swaption would cost $4MM, further eroding the value.  I spoke to Brett Wiggs on Friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work.DWR:They announced Thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor (approx 6,500MW long term).  The non-binding ""agreements in principle"" will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much.  DWR signed our Master Agreement for short term deals but Tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk.  We will not do anything with them at this time.Generator Tolls:  Interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices.  We are still talking with 6-7 parties, but I dont think anything will get done soon.  Munis:  Mcdonald got a small term sale done at NP-15 with city of Lassen.  Approx $600K of orig.New Marketing Initiatives:Negotiating 3 generator service agreements.  Mostly small plants coming on line this year.  The entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices , but many have already committed capital.  Montana: - State forced divestiture of generation.  Retail load is short starting July 1, 2002.  Governor's office has asked us to bring a 700MW 10 year ""solution"".  They are willing to issue a $500MM bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy.  The basic play is to swap an EPMI Mid-C position for an in-state position from PPL, package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid PPA.  Long shot but interesting.CA Industrials:  A group of industrials want to buy up to 800MW NP-15 delivered for 5+ years as part of a negotiated settlement with CA.  Gov Affairs is working on a Core/Non-Core structure with the state that would potentially lead to open access for all industrial load if they pay a big exit fee to cover the stranded costs incurred during the past 12 months.",christopher.calger@enron.com,"john.lavorato@enron.com, louise.kitchen@enron.com",X-From: Christopher F Calger <Christopher F Calger/ENRON@enronXgate@ENRON>,"X-To: John J Lavorato <John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate>, Louise Kitchen <Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT>",West Power Orig Update,"X-cc: Kimberly Hillis <Kimberly Hillis/ENRON@enronXgate>, Tammie Schoppe <Tammie Schoppe/HOU/ECT@ECT>",2001-06-11 13:58:00-07:00
"X-FileName: louise kitchen 2-7-02.pstAntelope is a project that we acquired last year from AES.  The project has land, some early permits, and a transmission queue position that we used at Pastoria.  Total consideration paid to AES was approximately $15MM, most of which was charged to Pastoria.  The resulting cost basis should be about $1.8MM plus the ERC's not used at Pastoria (approx. $6MM).

Overview of how we ended up in this crisis--include EPSA paper on crisis, EEI paper on crisis, and 1-2 articles from CA papers on the crisis.Load growth--California (show in terms of MWs, not percentages) and in WSCC.  Point is to show how load growth in California has been extraordinary relative to historical growth, show how entire west is growing.Generation additions--show how California and west did not keep pace with load growth.Consumption per capita or other measurements. Rate comparisons--show how west has had experienced substantial rate increases.  Compare actual increase in California to other states.MRW Study--show how $1 billion can be produced by 10% increase.  Show how increases experienced in--e.g., Nevada can produce revenues.  Transmission takeover analysis--show $39 billion price tag, compare with school funding.Solutions--include the Brulte or Herzberg piece.I would add the following pieces as well (just not sure where):Discussion of federal jurisdiction over transmission and generation--summarize FERC orders, including investigation.Why price caps aren't a solution.I started to look at our website yesterday and was unable to find a number of data points that I think we need to include in the b",paul.kaufman@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,,,Briefing Book,\Jeff_Dasovich_June2001\Notes Folders\Notes inbox,2001-04-02 08:18:00-07:00

The complete version of the following paper is available on my web pa=ge=20at:www.whogan.com????????ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGHSTRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIAScott Harvey and William W. HoganApril 24, 2001EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBeginning in June of 2000, the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the=20California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t=o=20correct the apparent market failures.? The public debate and policy=20discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal==20problem amenable to regulatory solution.? However, design of effective=20policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the=20diagnosis of the underlying causes.? High prices attributable largely to an==20exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular==20market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory=20action.? By contrast, high prices attributable to bad electricity market=20design would indicate a need for changes in the design.? High prices=20attributable to higher fuel prices, environmental constraints and capacity==20shortages, on the other hand, would prompt actions to address the cost of==20fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should=20receive the appropriate price signal for conservation.Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some=20capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market.? B=ut=20charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as=20exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply.?=20Likewise, refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke=t=20power.? Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers, t=he=20focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal=20generators in California.On its face, the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the=20exercise of market power could be important.? But at the same time the data==20show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th=at=20the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than==20demand has grown.? If anything, thermal generators that hit annual output==20limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000.?=20Furthermore, the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout==20the western market, both on and off peak,? indicate that if the exercise of==20market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels==20unprecedented in this or other electricity markets.? In short, this is a=20complicated story, and there is ample room for further investigation of the==20data and diagnosis of causes.Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals==20that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of=20electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the=20simplifying assumptions.? If strategic withholding were large and pervasive=,=20then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored=.?=20But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear, and any finding o=f=20the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the=20California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use=d=20in the analysis of the data.? For example, annual limits on production=20dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha=n=20direct incremental costs; hence, examinations of output decisions for=20individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete.? The variation in re=al=20time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output==20compared to the expectations given day-ahead prices; hence, with capacity==20constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal=20production at average prices.? Limits on the ramping rate of generation=20units, start-up costs, minimum load costs and other operational=20inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate==20hours and must be analyzed chronologically, recognizing these factors.? And==20so on.? Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the=20previous evidence.? Unfortunately, the real details are neither simple nor==20incidental.It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly==20available data.? A fuller analysis would require data available only to the==20California Independent System Operator, and has not been done.? Many factor=s=20contributed to higher electricity prices in California, and the market powe=r=20theme is only, at most, part of the story.? The import of the previous=20analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the=20California electricity market but, rather, to suggest that it might be=20important.? The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha=t=20market power has not been exercised in the electricity market? but, rather,==20to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b=e=20significant.? With the available data in the public domain, and the special==20complications introduced by the California market design, the margin of err=or=20in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through==20strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of=20magnitude as the effect being measured.? On balance, to date the publicly==20available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory=20Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic==20withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred.By contrast, there is general agreement that the California electricity=20market design is =01&seriously flawed.=018? Furthermore, there is evidence =that the=20policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an==20already serious market collapse.?

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended"" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582.

"Jeff,After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric Broadband (DCB). 1. The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you met recently at the YPO gathering. 2. DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is critical to success.3. We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.4. We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested in the investment.5. DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.6. About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  7. We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commitment.8.  At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal structure by the end of May.  We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB. I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make in DCB.

"KenI know it has been several years since we spoke, but I wanted to thank you =for your kind note, and to personally thank you for the opportunities that =Enron has provided to me over the years.I am one of those few who was already with HNG in 1984, and still vividly r=emember the day that you arrived.  The building was immediately permeated b=y a sense of urgency and excitement.  That pace was relentless - and addict=ive.  I also remember in detail the Internorth merger in 1985, and feel pro=ud to have played a part, however small it was, in that transaction.The late 1980's and the early 1990's will probably always be my favorite ye=ars of my working life.  There were so many initiatives in Enron in their i=nfancy.  Although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics =and ultimately failed, I am grateful that Enron gave me the opportunity to =participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure.  I never really understoo=d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l=earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes!!I will try to remember Enron with those years through the mid-1990's in min=d.  I have to say that I consider those to be the best years, because I hav=e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years.  =That is clearly a subjective assessment, and should be treated as such.  I =am under no illusions:  Enron is a business entity operating in markets and= environments that are relentlessly competitive, with a primary responsibil=ity to its shareholders.  But I and many of my colleagues who also have lon=g tenure at Enron and its predecessors share this assessment.  I am always =amused by the irony of the stated value ""Ruthlessness, callousness and arro=gance do not belong here"", since these appear to be the key defining person=al characteristics of most of the senior management of ENA in recent years.And unfortunately, the very sale of HPL by Enron has been for some an examp=le of the degradation of corporate culture.  For myself, I know what to exp=ect - I know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf=ormation as the transaction evolves.  But for the ""rank and file"" - those w=ho live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience. = They maintained their professionalism (indeed many of them probably worked= harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen).  In return, ther=e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from =Enron management and HR department with respect to their benefits and caree=r choices.  HR in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual =inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails fro=m HPL employees with questions, even after the transaction was announced.  =Even as recently as the past couple of days, only upon receipt of their ter=mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m=isinformed by HR with respect to some aspects of their remaining Enron bene=fits.For myself, my years at Enron will remain a high point of my career.  It is= a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at Enron,= particularly for as many years as I was there.  I know Enron will continue= to set the standards by most measures in this industry, and, for what its =worth, I humbly wish you continued success.ThanksLee Papayoti---------------------- Forwarded by Lee L Papayoti/HOU/ECT on 05/31/2001 11=:53 AM ---------------------------From:=09Kenneth Lay/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/30/2001 03:00 PMTo:=09Tom Acton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Janie Aguayo/HOU/ECT@ECT, Amelia Alland/H=OU/ECT@ECT, Lauri A Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Aric Archie/NA/Enron@Enron, Karl E A=tkins/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeffrey A.

That relationship shall be determined based on common law= as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S. Internal Revenue Servi=ce Revenue Ruling 87-41. Accordingly, for purposes of applying Opinion 25, =a grantee meets the definition of an employee if the grantor consistently r=epresents that individual to be an employee under common law. The definitio=n of an employee for payroll tax purposes under the U.S. Internal Revenue C=ode includes common law employees. Accordingly, a grantor that classifies a= grantee potentially subject to U.S. payroll taxes as an employee under Opi=nion 25 must also (except as provided in paragraph 6) represent that indivi=dual as an employee for payroll tax purposes. A grantee does not meet the d=efinition of an employee under Opinion 25 solely because the grantor repres=ents that individual as an employee for some, but not all, purposes. For ex=ample, a requirement or decision to classify a grantee as an employee for U=.S. payroll tax purposes does not, by itself, indicate that the grantee is =an employee for purposes of Opinion 25 because the grantee must also be an =employee of the grantor under common law.We will base part of our conclusion on the answer we are provided.

"X-Origin: Sanders-RX-FileName: Sanders, Richard B (Non-Privileged).pstRichard, Howard seems to acknowledge that the FERC proceedings could themse=lves, within several months, could bring us to the point of knowing the amo=unt of our claim against PGE even without the benefit of the formula sugges=ted by Weg's proposal.  That raises the question of what we get from the We=g settlement.  Although he has not specifically articulated the benefits, H=oward would tell you that his settlement would avoid the cost of litigating= the splits, would avoid the delay attendant to inevitable challenges of a =contested FERC order and would get our collateral back sooner rather than l=ater.  I'm still not entirely clear about the procedure he intends to adopt= to get his deal done and whether there are potential impediments.  He has =characterized the deal as a bankruptcy compromise between PX, the debtor, a=nd the participants.  If all the participants go along, that characterizati=on is ok.  If some participants (Mirant/SCE) oppose, the only way you can b=ind them to the deal in the PX bankruptcy is through a reorganization plan,= and that itself will take time.  Weg seems to think that most participants= will go along.  I'm sure Edison would oppose.  Although they aren't a favo=red party in the PX case, they could have the ability to stymie a settlemen=t.  Next, the settlement also impacts PGE and its bankruptcy.  If PGE doesn='t go along, it can argue that its bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to fix= the claims against PGE, not the PX bankruptcy court.  Then the settlement =needs to be presented to and adopted by FERC---again an opportunity for par=ties to object.  These procedural hurdles may not have to be dealt with, bu=t I've received no good exposition of how they would be if they in fact mat=erialize.

Unfortunately it wasn't what =we wanted to hear.On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =customers received a letter letting them know about it.On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,= IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =our larger customers through the reps.So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial= .......1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding= as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=203.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=204.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=lly matter at the end of the day.

"X-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: VKAMINS (Non-Privileged).pstGreg,A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.More detailed notes by Steve are attached.I. Major potential projects (in the order they suggested it).	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without	full trade automation.	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.	Any project would require review of the market data provided by Enron.  (Is it a  free option for them? -  VK) II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments    per project, and   fees per transaction.	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 	    Enron's participation.	2. Payment per project that would look like consulting fees. They would like a lump-sum payment	    first (to expand the staff), followed by consulting fees later. 	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.Recommendations:	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship                with UBS.	3.

"X-FileName: JDASOVIC (Non-Privileged).pstJeff,We have never met, but I have read and enjoyed your articles on Enron's bold business vision.  Stan Marek, head of Marek Brothers, in Houston is a good friend of mine, and he suggested I call youdirectly, but I think an email may be more efficient.I am CTO and Senior VP of R&D for a software company called Hyprotech.  We are second in the global market for process simulation technology, but I think first in innovation.One of Hyprotech's philosophies is to ""model to the business boundary"".  This allows a business leader to have as clearer vision of the technical behavior of an asset to any depth and fidelity that isappropriate per the desired modeling investment.We do whole-asset models of refineries, chemical plants and power plants.  Also, Hyprotech is the only company with the full technical capability of modeling the entire business asset for oil and gasoperations from sand face to custody transfer (well-bore, riser, piping network, topside processing, transmission, separation, gas plant, compression, metering). As a result, Hyprotech has 80% of thismarket.Hyprotech is deeply into real-time online modeling for decision support and optimization.We have been discussing with gas storage industry the possibility of basing trading on a full dynamic model of the facility.  The business motivator is that a full scope model coupled to an contractand business parameters allows for a better estimate of the sensitivities of a trade.I am a Enron stockholder and naturally thought that perhaps the same methodology can be applied as a real-time model-based data filter coupled to Enron's current decision support models for trading.The real-time model is a virtual facility (much as a flight simulator is a virtual airplane) and should increase understanding, open up new possibilities, reduce risk and increase agility in trades.My question is who at Enron the most appropriate person for discussing details and practicalities of this concept for your company?Thanks for your attention,Dr. Mark R.

The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said. Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate. Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market. The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,X-From: Jeff Dasovich,X-To: Richard Shapiro,Re: Davis & Company -- incompetence personified,X-cc: Susan J Mara,2001-07-06 06:28:00-07:00
"Here is an update of our activities.All of my standard reports should be completed by the end of next week, which will allow me to provide thorough and concise report of all positions and values.Portfolio ManagementCompleted assignment of all portfolio companies to senior team membersSold 20% stake in Paladin Resources (a UK public E&P company) for 44p totaling $25 million.  This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.Completed all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as ""Strategic"", and any losses upon the sale will fall ""below the line"" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.Completed negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.Finalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.  Needless to say, we are very focused on this investment.Losses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately $10 million for Q3, which is primarily the result of write-offs in the HEOF portfolio.Net quarterly expectations: Cash proceeds received from sales - ~$250 million, losses from sales below carrying value ~$60 million ($46 million ""above the line"" and $14 million ""below the line"").  IntegrationAll personnel decisions made.Legal (Gil Melman), RAC (Randy Petersen), accounting (Hope Vargas), HR (Sheila Walton) and Tax (Jim Sandt) support personnel determined.Everyone moving to same location (EB36) today.Preparation of 2nd half 2001 budget (revenue and expense) still in process.

On September 27, 2001, RRI announced it would acquire Orion Powerfor $26.80 in an all-cash transaction.	?	2. In our view this deal has very positive implications forthe sector.  The purchase price is essentially in-line with our estimate ofthe private market value of ORN's asset portfolio ($26.83).  Overall, thedeal gives us addition confidence in our valuation framework and reinforcesour view that valuations in the sector are extremely attractive.  	?	3. RRI is leaving unchanged its 2002 EPS guidance of$2.05-$2.15.  In doing so, RRI noted that the earnings contribution fromthis deal (+$0.30) will offset the negative impact of sluggish conditions inthe Western power markets.  	?	4. Our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates remain unchanged at $1.62and $1.95.  Our 2002 estimate continues to be below company guidance, givingus comfort in our forecast.  	?	5. Importantly, for 2002 RRI's Western generation assets arecurrently less than 50% hedged, which is well below the company's peersincluding CPN (Strong Buy, $19.75) and MIR (Buy, $19.60).  As such, thecompany is relatively more exposed to commodity price volatility in thatregion of the country.    6. We are reducing our target price to $30 from $40.  We derive thisvaluation from our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, which employs an11.4% discount rate.  Our revised target price reflects: 1. The $2.9 billionacquisition expenditure; 2. The $1.8 billion of assumed net debt; 3. Theincremental earnings and synergies associated with the deal; and, 4. Theearnings shortfall at RRI's Western operations and slower overall growthprospects for the business.  Regards,Neil Stein   212/325-4217This message is for the named person's use only.

Here are the main points:1) After the March  fix-up, Raptor hedged ENE credit capacity all the way down to ENE $20/share.  And the collars are consists of European type options.  The maturities are:  original collars for Raptor I, II, IV will mature in 2003.  The new collars for Raptor II and IV will mature in 2005.  2) The collars were transacted with ENE.3) The option settling method will be equity method.  Enron will hand over shares at the maturity.  But there is a maximum 3 share per option limit.   For example:   With a strike of $80,  if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares.   But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM.  Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.6) While the raptors have hedged Enron's credit capacities,  the current Enron credit capacity dropped from around ($36MM) after the fix up, to around ($237MM) as of 8/20/01.Hope these information help answering some of the question you had.Ding.",j.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,,,FW: Meeting with Gordon on Raptor,"\VKAMINS (Non-Privileged)\Kaminski, Vince J\Sent Items",2001-08-27 09:27:52-07:00

I wanted to reconfirm the scope/focus of oureffort with the attached chart.As we discussed, our primary focus is around pushing the M&A case foraction and options.  This effort is well underway.As we also discussed, we will push forward on the stock price valuationfrom the standpoint of (1) understanding the likely impact of potentialdisclosures/write-offs, and (2) assessing the value which Enron shouldattribute to the stock if you were to use it as an M&A currency.  This steprequires some recharacterization of baseline earnings and you expressed theconcern that it would be difficult to address this topic prior to thecompletion of the budget process.  We think we can approximate the impactmore quickly through an alternative process, which we will describe onThursday.Finally, we think we should spend some time addressing fallback optionsbesides M&A (see chart).Please give me a call on my cell phone (713) 480-2087, or leave a voicemailat (713) 751-4309 to confirm that we are (or are not) on the right track.I look forward to seeing you Thursday.Regards.(See attached file: 1 PAGER ho0400 (9-24-01).ppt)+-------------------------------------------------------------+| This message may contain confidential and/or privileged     || information.

However, they were supposed to be for ST-Wserv to receive those money because at that time, ST-WServ book was not set up yet. These amounts had already gone through to ST-Whouly book in 11/30/00 P&L as PMA. In Jun 2001, the deals were changed to ST-WServ book but they were not actually picked up by settlement and Risk (as the deals have already liquidated, i.e., strip dates are passed). In order to reflect the change in desk, we need to put in two annuities today:#683673 - St-Wserv sell to St-Whourly for $53,518.94#683684 - St-Wserv sell to St-Whourly for $172,518.16These amounts will be showing up in 7/12 P&L as New Deals for a total of $226,037.10 (inflow to St-WServ and outflow to St-Whourly).Please let me know if you have any questions.Samantha -----Original Message-----From: 	Law, Samantha  Sent:	Thursday, July 12, 2001 11:17 AMTo:	Hyde, GodfreyCc:	Postlethwaite, John; Chang, Fran; Rawson, Lester; Foster, Chris H.; Clemons, Amy; Confer, MarkSubject:	RE: Annuities for Desk Analysis in ST-WServ book[I have sent out this email earlier but I needed to revise it so I recalled it. For those of you who received the earlier version, please just discard it.]Hi Godfrey,I would like to summarize our discussion on those deals we have had questions about (as described in the previous emails), in terms of when and how they will be come through or corrected in the coming future. Please review and let me know if they are not correct:1. #442038 - the change in the annuity amount of $4,706.28 (from $53,518.94 to $48,812.66) will be coming through in June desk analysis (= PMA at the end of July) as an outflow to ST-WServ book. Chris and Les - I will put in a new annuity deal for the amount of $53,518.94 for St-WServ book sell to St-Whourly to reflect the change in desk (from St-Whourly to St-WServ) of the deal; the desk change made on 4/17 was not picked up by settlement as they were not informed. With the adjustment, the net effect of $48,812.66 will be given back to WServ.2. #584331 - it will come through in June desk analysis3. #600480 & #595779 - since these are interdesk deals, we will take care of it by entering two new annuity deals today (#680210 & #680220). They were not picked up by settlement as PMA when they were entered on 5/2 & 4/29 because they were interdesk deals.4. #598971(leg 1-5) - they will show up in July desk analysis (= PMA at the end of August)5. #442872 - the change in the annuity amount of $126,542.87 (from $172,518.16 to $45,975.29) will be coming through in Jun desk analysis as an outflow to ST-WServ book.Again, the change in desk (from St-Whouly to St-WServ) will then be reflected by a new annutiy deal for $172,518.16 with ST-WServ sell to ST-Whouly.6. #666350 & #666351 - they will show up in June desk analysis (= PMA at the end of July)Please feel free to correct or add anything to the above information.Thanks,Samantha503.464.7248",samantha.law@enron.com,"h..foster@enron.com, lester.rawson@enron.com, kate.symes@enron.com, ","Bcc: john.postlethwaite@enron.com, fran.chang@enron.com","X-From: Law, Samantha </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SLAW>",	bill.williams@enron.com,"X-To: Foster, Chris H. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cfoster>, Rawson, Lester </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lrawson>, Symes, Kate </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ksymes>, Williams III, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bwillia5>",2001-07-12 11:59:01-07:00

We hope you and your  team felt that the time was well spent and you found the Boltzmann concepts and  model to be both interesting and compelling. We know that we  threw alot of very detailed information at you in a relatively small amount of  time and of course it will take some time to digest. We're thinking that  the best way forward may be a small research or prototype project where Enron  and Toshiba may be able to jointly test, analyze and benchmark the application  of this concept -- to determine it's feasibility and potential business  benefit.  We are very interested in your thoughts about this  idea. We have  attached the 2 briefings that were given for your use and internal distribution  as appropriate.  We have also attached other potentially useful information  (published papers, etc.) for your use as you attempt to better understand  the Boltzmann Model and underlying concepts.

If the field text is red, do not type over it!- The detail sheet has fields for filling in your 2001 budget and your 2001 estimate.  You can get the budget number from your June cost center report, in the ""Plan Total Year"" field, and can use the ""Act per 1-6"" field to help you calculate your 2001 estimate.- I'm not aware of any activities that would involve capital expenditures, so that worksheet should be blank.  If you think you have capital expenditures please call me to discuss.- We'll be getting EPSC and EIS estimates shortly.  We'll fill in those numbers when received.The schedule for the process is as follows:August 6 - Worksheets due to me, and department meetings with Steve beginAugust 13 - Worksheets due from me to Financial PlanningAugust 20 - Meetings with Skilling beginTerraso's group - Please review your worksheet with Mike before you submit it to me.Palmer's group - Please submit your worksheet to me directly and I'll prepare a summary for Mark.If you'd like some help preparing your spreadsheet, I'm happy to oblige.  However, please schedule early if you need such assistance so that I don't get buried on August 3rd.

I'm not sure what format you'll receive it in, but if its the standard format, it'll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates.I have access to the team/project level estimates, and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you.I was going to try to guess how you would like to see it, but I thought I'd better ask you first, ....it'll probably save me a lot of work! :) The thought was to give you a quick handle on whats ""essential-keep the business running"" stuff, and what would be great but we can struggle on without.Please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads-up, and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later.Some alternatives (obviously, feel free to suggest your own)1.Capital	Team		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $				Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $Expense		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $				Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $2.Capital	Team								% Essential	% Nice to Have		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $			40%		60%		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $			80%		20%Expense		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $				Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $Please let me know what you would prefer, and I'll try to get you the view by the end of the day.regardsSteve",stephen.stock@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,,,Budget,"\ExMerge - Kitchen, Louise\'Americas\IT",2001-08-31 07:30:29-07:00

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.Thanks!John Sherriff(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.Please communicate this policy to your staff.Michael Brown",steven.kean@enron.com,"mark.palmer@enron.com, david.oxley@enron.com, cindy.olson@enron.com, ","X-To: Mark Palmer, David Oxley, Cindy Olson, Richard Shapiro",X-cc: ,	richard.shapiro@enron.com,X-bcc: ,2001-07-09 00:56:00-07:00

DSL will be the choice in 10.5 million, satellite by 4.5 million and fixed wireless will serve 359,000.

Larry is on board with  the concept but reserves opinion on the scaleability of the business.   We have retooled the business model to concentrate on bigger  return projects, resulting in a plan that better fits the Enron  formula.  Additionally the skill set of the team (3) will provide  additional value and leverage to existing EGM transactions-especially in the  area of moving assets off balance sheet. Jeremy Thirsk  has first hand knowledge as we have helped structure a Japan trade. Also, Ray Bowen will take on a small team at EIM, as he has bought into  the value return. Larry suggests it is worthwhile for EGM to consider the  proposal further. To this end, I request a meeting with you anytime on  Tuesday or Wednesday next week. I return to London on Thursday.

FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source andsink)The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.

The other is a turbine purchase agreement.A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.

Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.

"Dear Ken,I would like to thank you for the great experience that I had with Enron,and for the opportunity that you gave me three years ago. I joined Enronlooking for a change and I have never regretted of my choice.A lot of things changed over this time. In my first presentation to Gazpromin Moscow, I remember, that I pictured Enron as the largest gas pipelineoperator in Americas aggressively looking for energy development projects inemerging markets. Two years later, I was talking to Microsoft executives inRedmond, who were looking for a partner to conquer a high-tec broadbandworld. I don't know any other company, which can offer such an opportunityfor a change and growth, and which is able to change itself so much asEnron.I am grateful that over this time you have been personally involved in mybusiness career and introduced me to the Enron management team - MarkFrevert, Richard DiMichele, Vince Kaminsky and others.I also would like to use this opportunity to admit some of my mistakes. Asit was my first experience inside a corporate environment (not as CEO), ittook me some time to develop relationships with people inside Enron. Theserelationships are critical to achieving success within the company. ButEnron is a great place to learn, and in a culture that encourages innovationand risk-taking, some mistakes are inevitable. I am pleased that the dealthat my team and I developed and managed to provide Microsoft (MSN) withbroadband network was successful (you may remember we discussed this ideaprior to my move to Enron Broadband Services).This spring I took an advantage of your recommendation and graduated fromthe Harvard Advanced Management Program. It was a great experience and Ilearned professionally and personally.  It was a very competitive group ofexecutives from all over the world, and the program consisted of athree-month intensive academic curriculum. Together with one of my Harvardclassmates and his Canadian telecom company, we are now working to start anew business in the US.You have a challenging task to return Enron to its leadership position. Iadmire the steps that you are making. Without restoring integrity tointernal and external relationships, it would be impossible to achieve thisgoal. I have no doubts that you and your colleagues will make this happen.I wish you all the best and thank you again for the opportunity that youoffered me. I hope that our paths will cross again.Best regards to you and your family,Boris BrevnovTel.

Sometimes the only alternative to communications is emails.I just wanted to get in touch with you and just let you know that this facility was finally sold.  The buyer is EOTT.  I have been offered a position with EOTT and their benefits seem to be comparable to Enron's however there are some changes.  After 19 years I hate to leave Enron, so I just wanted to see if you would keep me in mind if any positions become available.  Working in the scheduling and nominations area for you with NNG has been the most rewarding experience in my career and I would love to get back to an areas where I felt that I excelled.  I know that there has been some changes in the last few years, however, there is nothing holding me back at this time.   I certainly would have stayed if my family situation would not have been what it was 5 years ago.  I was not looking for a job, God just seemed to drop it down at  time that I needed to do something.  Speaking of family, my daughter J'Nel has grown up to be a wonderful, beautiful, responsible and extremely lovable daughter.  We have become such great friends.  The adolescence years gave both of us some major growth in our lives for the best.  She is living in England right now, working and going to college.

"Mark, which attorney is handling this matter? Jim -----Original Message-----From: =09Gold, Joe =20Sent:=09Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:38 AMTo:=09McMahon, Jeffrey; Sherriff, JohnCc:=09Kitchen, Louise; Bowen Jr., Raymond; Brown, Michael - COO London; Gol=d, Joe; Derrick Jr., James; Farmer, Michael; Heffron, Kevin; Hutchinson, Mi=chael; Jones, Timothy; Lynch, DrewSubject:=09EML Capital Adequacy and LiquidityJeff / John,We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals =Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi=ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und=erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft=er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co=ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh=eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please =let us know.Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe GoldIntroductionEnron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. = EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b=rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b=usinesses:1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's p=olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond=uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship= to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=e FSA and the LME.3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi=ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=ease carrying on business.4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for= a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines= and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members= under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=elating to directors' duties.Directors Overriding Ring Fencing ObligationIn the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.Issues Surrounding LiquidityAs we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was= concerned =20The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains= and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,= it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its= day to day liquidity.=20=20In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it= must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=ions.Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from= the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c=ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'=s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be= transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the re=maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=ity impact.The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =agreed to start to do the followinga.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=he rest of the enterpriseb.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control= as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnelc.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints= of continuing to do business on a normal basisd.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basise.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidityf.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basisOperational Risk =20In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either= capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be= substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f=aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.CapitalAs noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu=st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions= when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the= FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress TestingThe stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral= rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =brokers4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=205)=09Credit exposures leading to credit lossesRecommendationsThe result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following= changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=erall operational liquidity1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=ubordinated facility2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=ty by six months to July 20024)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=ts and other assets held by EML5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch= to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=d for calling margin6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=an a select group of key relationship clients=207)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory financeCurrent SituationUnsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mmSecured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mmSubordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mmEML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mmCash required to replaceWithdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm)EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128%Excess Reg.

Ron has tried(unsucessfully) to reach you over the last couple of weeks and  we arefully sensitive to how difficult it is to find time to speak these days.In that context, Ron and I felt that a brief note might be best.   As youknow, we worked at Jeff Donahue and Mitch Taylor's request for several daysto develop a synthesis of the Enron Wholesale Services business model.This model centered around the cash/earnings generation power of EnronNorth America's gas and power franchise and the related working capitaldynamics.  We also began to develop a model to explain how VaR, volatility,and price drive Enron Wholesale Services' proprietary tradingprofitability.  When we were asked to leave a week ago this effort was wellunderway, but still incomplete.We believe that these analyses, as well as an integrated view of the EnronWholesale Services business model, will be central to any investor's duediligence process.  To the extent you feel this process needs to beaccelerated or enhanced, we stand ready to help at this critical time.Finally, we have billed you for the capital markets diagnostic workcompleted several weeks ago.  As agreed, we only invoiced you for two weeksof work.

WhiteWing also involves outside equity, and in addition to other concerns, has limitations on sales below contributed value [the book value on the transfer to WhiteWing]. Given the current situation concerning related party transactions, I recommend approval from the Enron Corp.

"X-Origin: Lay-KX-FileName: klay (Non-Privileged).pstKen,  Thanks for your message.  Communication, even if it is brief, from yo=u is absolutely critical at this time.  While Enron has a very tough road a=head, I think I can speak for several people on my team that we are support=ive of the non-Dynegy route regardless of the option we ultimately plan to =pursue.  I know the best thing I can do for Enron is to sell our remaining =assets to either BG or another counter party.  I am committed to this task =and we will continue to focus on BG, but we need to be prepared that it may= be necessary to take a different path to sell the India E&P assets.  In a =strange way, the termination of the Dynegy merger may actually help the E&P= sale because it takes away the automatic loss of operatorship ONGC was usi=ng as leverage.  Depending on Enron Corp.'s plans, we may have a much stron=ger message to play with our Indian partners and the GOI.  They should be c=oncerned that we will keep ownership and operatorship long term, and they s=hould also be concerned that we will not want to spend the capital to expan=d the projects (something the GOI/ONGC really wants to do).  After you anno=unce Corp's plan, I will go to India and meet with our partners and the GOI= in this regard.     =20Based on your note below and earlier comments, I know the trading business =is a key component to your future core operations.  I am supportive of that= decision because I saw the enormous value it can generate in the right cir=cumstances.  As I have mentioned before, I think the company should sell bu=sinesses such as the E&P company that are non-core.  It is the right thing =to do, especially in these circumstances.  However, some of the non-core bu=sinesses generate good cashflow (like the E&P company) and we have to be ca=reful in this environment to make sure the company supports the ""valuable"" =non-core businesses until they can be monetized. =20I also know most of your senior advisors are disciples of the trading  busi=ness.  Because they grew up in that environment, they are very comfortable =and knowledgeable of this business model and there will be tremendous press=ure to maintain certain trading activities or people for the future even wh=en the near-term value is questionable.  I hope somebody at the table asks =the question, if we focus our limited financial resources to maintain this =future benefit, have we lost a ""valuable near-term non-core"" resource?  I k=now these decisions are not easy or clear-cut,  but in this new paradigm th=is could happen pretty easily since most of the players at the table do not= understand Enron's non-core businesses or what it takes to optimize near-t=erm value. This comment is not intended to offend anybody, but it is a conc=ern.For example,  Enron made financial commitments of $10.5 million to our staf=f to maintain operations and sell our assets.  We've sold everything except= EOGIL and we have negotiated mutually acceptable PSA's with two different =companies for EOGIL, but due to some extra-ordinary circumstances, this has= proven to be a tough sale.  As I mentioned in the first paragraph, I think= we can get there, but it may take a little more time and we need to mainta=in staff during the interim.=20I recognize everything has changed due to recent events.  I am not asking f=or a handout because that is the way it was before or anything like that.  =My point is the company will have to make tough decisions regarding which i=ndividuals to incentivize and I believe the existing commitments to the E&P= team should be maintained even though this is a non-core business.  Reaffi=rming the company's commitment to the $10.5 million will give us a good pro=bability of keeping enough of the core staff to achieve our goals and monet=ize the assets soon. I recognize that $10.5 million is not a trivial sum of= money, but without these individuals we stand to lose $50 to $100 million =in the next 12 months; therefore, I have believe this is the right decision= for Enron.I believe EGEP is one of the ""valuable"" non-core businesses, but if this be=comes a point of controversy I would at least like the opportunity to prese=nt my case in person to one of you.=20Thanks for taking the time to read my note.=20Jeff -----Original Message-----From: =09Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman =20Sent:=09Wednesday, November 28, 2001 4:23 PMTo:=09DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide1Subject:=09UpdateAs you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.

Transaction count on EnronOnline (media and investors)For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward.  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement, volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of 5,800 transactions with a notional value of $2.7 billion. ?	Quantification of litigation (media and investors)o	no specific comment on litigationo	shareholder suits likely to be consolidatedo	$3.5 billion ""basket"" in merger agreement is designed to cover all Enron litigation (i.e. not just shareholder litigation) and the parties believe this will be sufficient?

Can Enron even participate in the Arctic project as a $1mm commitment will, not including the potential additional liabilities, commit the company for more than $50mm.

Brenda Fletcher was asking me Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP11131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.

"To All Employees:This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.Ken",chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,,,Enron Files Chapter 11 Reorganization,"\ExMerge - Swerzbin, Mike\Inbox",2001-12-02 19:45:26-08:00

"X-bcc: X-Folder: \ExMerge - Kitchen, Louise\'Americas\South AmericaX-Origin: KITCHEN-LX-FileName: louise kitchen 2-7-02.pstJohn:The following points outline the current status of the project for our discussion at 2:30 pm (Houston):Budget:  The attached spreadsheet outlines the current status of the budget as compared to previous reports.  The basic status is that we have $4 million in unallocated contingency and are basically on budget. Sales Process:  We have received one indicative proposal from Perez Companc to purchase 50% of the project equity in the asset company at approximately $3 million below book.  This offer is only for the asset company and does not include any transfer of the upside of the marketing company.  Total has indicated that they will give us an offer next week, but this has been delayed several times.  We are currently scheduled to complete the process with Perez Companc prior to year-end, but the schedule is aggressive.OPIC Financing:  The main finance agreement should be complete by early next week.  We have worked with OPIC over the last few days to change certain parts of the deal structure to accelerate the process.  OPIC is now indicating more willingness to work towards a year-end closing.  The financing would represent $190 million in financing out of a total capital budget of approximately $282 million.Construction Financing Structure:  All construction costs for the project are currently financed through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB as the lead bank in the group.  The financing vehicle contemplates the take-out of the vehicle upon the completion of construction.  The definition is in accordance with the construction contract.  Final completion of construction will not be completed until late December or early January in accordance with the construction contract due to the final completion of the water treatment facilities.  We are currently using temporary facilities to run the plant.Enron Equity:  Under the current process, Enron would need to contribute approximately $45 million in equity in the final capital structure of the project assuming the indicative offer we have from Perez Companc.  The basic issue is the timing of the OPIC financing and equity syndication closing and the WestLB take-out.Commercial Operations:  Upon the completion of testing of the eight unit next week, we are planning to declare the start date under the Petrobras agreement such that we can begin receiving the guaranteed payment.  The conflict created with this action is that this could create problems with WestLB under the construction financing vehicle.  The contract is clear that the take-out must occur upon completion in accordance with the construction contract which shall not have ocurred.  However, the banks have stated in the past that they did not contemplate taking operating risk.  We are working with the finance agreement to ensure that we have a coordinated strategy and story for the banks to keep them comfortable.  However, there is a risk that the banks will push for a take-out during this period.Turbine:  We are currently evaluting the purchase of a turbine (only the engine) which is required to be on-site for operational purposes.  This is not a ninth turbine generating set as we had previously discussed.  The plan to date has been to lease this unit from GE.  However, we were presented an offer to buy a used unit with significantly better economics and operating conditions than the lease.  With our current status in the budget, we believe that we can accomplish this and still be under the original construction budget as outlined in the attached table.  We are currently expecting to receive a $6.8 million tax rebate, we have been able to defer $2.5 million in expenditures contemplated in the original budget (still included above) and we have unallocated contingency of $4 million.Thanks,Brett",brett.wiggs@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,"Bcc: ranabir.louise@enron.com, orlando.gonzalez@enron.com, m..joseph@enron.com, ",	chip.schneider@enron.com,Eletrobolt Review,"X-From: Wiggs, Brett </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=NOTESADDR/CN=B8234AA3-F73ED463-862568E0-2FA20E>",2001-10-31 13:14:04-08:00

In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million inelectric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing.Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, inessence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much itinvested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a 1998forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast.TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that thisamount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the endof 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, theCommission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecastedamount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  Therehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electricdistribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject torefund.2.

My objective is to make sure you are fully up to speed on what we are doing, the accounting treatment we are using, and Corp's position on it all.A little background. Since January, I have been working with Jim Bouillion's Corporate Risk Management team to create trading revenue through the proactive management of our corporate insurance needs --- what we are now calling Portfolio Management Revenue and booking to the MPR. Two examples of this which we pushed through in the 3Q follow below:A.	1 transaction booked trading our political risk insurance book for total value of $716,000. Received risk sharing premium by modifying deductible, stop loss limits, 	coverage diversification and country diversification covered	under OPIC and with our commercial coverage and risk retention in our Vermont captive. P&L Reported:	Reported MPR		$  716,000B.	1 transaction booked for Hainan, China for total value of $ 406,000. Cancelled original stand alone insurance	policy with limited currency convertibility coverage and 	reissued coverage through Enron Re for lower premium, saving business unit $75,000, and better coverage. Reinsured Enron Re through commercial program and	netted $406,000. P&L Reported:	Reported MPR		$  406,000For the 4Q we have a number of similar transactions going through. The fundamental business change I'm trying to implement is to have each Enron business unit pay market prices for their insurance cover, leaving IRM's Corporate Risk Management team the incentive to capture insurance risk trading revenues by dynamically managing the risk on an aggregated basis. Historically, any work Jim's team did was considered expense reduction and was simply refunded to Corp or directly to the business units. I consider this risk management activity to be no different than any commodity trading book at Enron where the risk manager (trader) keeps the value they create by trading efficiently in the market. Our market just happens to be insurance and our bid/offer spread is the difference between insurance and reinsurance premiums. These transactions are an effort to test the concept and push the system. The transactions we expect to push through in Q4 are:C.	1 transaction to be booked as the second instalment of ""A"" above. The OPIC risk sharing premium was split into two payments over 3Q and 4Q.	To be reported to MPR	$700,000D.	1 transaction to be booked in our property insurance book. It is connected with EES's acquisition of Limbach. The market price for their insurance coverage is $400,000 which is being charged to them.  By placing the property asset physical damage coverage in the property program, we get automatic coverage for new acquisitions (up to certain values). The insurance market only charges when significant values are added or if the asset acquired is of a different nature than the mix already in the portfolio, for example, the paper mill acquisitions have generated a charge.	To be reported to MPR	$400,000E.	1 transaction to be booked capturing the value of our property coverage with Aegis and Energy Insurance Mutual. The insurance coverage essentially has a dividend option built into it based on Aegis's or EIM's overall loss experience during the year. These dividends are like going long options on loss experience and were captured by Corporate Risk Management's selection of dividend generating markets to write the coverage. (AEGIS also writes one of the broadest policy forms in the market and is very competitive on price.) 	To be reported to MPR	$893,000In addition. there is 1 transaction related to the sale of ENA assets (the Peakers) which normally would not have resulted in a property insurance refund. Jim's team negotiated with the underwriters and won a concession to recognize a reduction in premium midway through the year. The property program is an umbrella facility which gives us flexibility to move assets in and out of the program subject to the total value of the property and classification (hence the income recognized in ""D""). We couldn't come up with a good defence for why this should be treated as revenue so we decided to take it in as a negative expense and avoid possible questions down the road. The total value we'll credit to expenses will be approx. $1.012 million. In addition, our group had over $600,000 of peaker transaction expenses that we were not reimbursed for when the insurance market transaction we were pursuing had to be cancelled after the sale of the assets.  Karen has had a number of conversations with the Enron Corp acctg group. They do not have issues with the portfolio mgmt revenue as it is still below their materiality scope, somewhere around $5 million.Hope this helps set the stage for our discussion this afternoon.Per",per.sekse@enron.com,"mike.mcconnell@enron.com, a..shankman@enron.com","X-To: Mcconnell, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmccon1>, Shankman, Jeffrey A. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jshankm>",X-cc: ,FW: Accounting of Portfolio Management Revenue for Insurance Risk,X-bcc: ,2001-10-31 06:06:53-08:00

"X-Origin: Whalley-GX-FileName: GWHALLE (Non-Privileged).pstMark, Jeff and Greg,  There has been some recent noise at CalPERS regarding Enron, some of which you may be aware.  I wanted to update you in case any questions were raised tomorrow on the conference call.In October CA state Senator Steve Peace sent a letter to the CEO of PERS raising ""questions about the prudence of CalPERS continuing to invest and partner with Enron under its current management"".  I discussed this with the Alternative Investment (AIM) staff (with whom I deal with regularly regarding JEDI II).  They indicated at the time that a senior staff meeting was being held (on Friday Nov 2nd) to discuss the letter and how PERS might respond.  Subsequent to that, staff informed me that the board had put Enron on the agenda to discuss during today's (Tuesday the 13th) Investment Committee meeting.  I have not received an update as yet today on today's meeting.  The fact that the board was meeting to discuss Enron has been reported in the media.Meanwhile, on Friday the 9th, Dan Szente the CIO resigned from PERS.  Articles indicate it may be a result of 7.2 percent loss in the funds' investments.  PERS holds approx 2.6 million shares of Enron.  This has also been mentioned in articles discussing Dan's resignation - thus attempting to link his resignation with our poor performance?? Earlier in the year their proxy vote indicated they owned 3.5 million shares. [BTW - they voted against Item 1 - specifically mentioning Lay, Wakeham and Winokur as having relationships with Enron that could cause conflicts of interest.}  PERS assets total $151 billion.  It appears they may have liquidated some of their position.  I am not sure but I think their position has been one they have held for a long time - possibly since beginning our relationship with JEDI back in 1993.  The JEDI II partnership has been a successful partnership for PERS and current IRRs indicate they could earn in excess of 50% on their investment based on the September 30 capital account.  This of course, assumes we can liquidate the assets in JEDI I for their current fair value.  Also - PERS purchased approx. 7.2 million shares in NPW for $40 million - a cost basis of $5.50 a share.

"FYI on budgets. We almost have the total IT depreciation pulled together. The systems development budget is moving down since our meeting.  We are meeting heavily with operations and the business unit heads or their designees to get those numbers down to what is necessary for 2002. Got some agreement on headcount analysis form Wes today and will confirm with all other business units tomorrow so Jenny's budget will be accurate and the projected 2002 headcount accurate as well. Richter is in tough spot trying to roll out the EOL pricing methodology to EA, EGM, EEL and EIM but he is doing the best he can.  The good news is that you know the total and they agree with the total. Operations is almost agreed to.  Most business unit heads are close to their operations person (Bbo Hall, Brent Price, Kevin Sweeney, Beth Apollo) so they trust their budget recommendations. Final complaint is, as expected, indirects but we are trying to get to yes on that. When this is better in a few days, I will e-mail you a new sheet like the one we showed you that has new expenses, new capital and the TOTAL IT depreciation number. Thanks.

Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.Thank you,Steve",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,a..lindholm@enron.com,,,FW: REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority,"\TGEACCO (Non-Privileged)\Geaccone, Tracy\Sent Items",2001-10-02 08:35:48-07:00

The co=mplaint was brought against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skill=ing and Andrew Fastow. The case is numbered H-01-3736. The Honorable Melind=a Harmon is the Judge presiding over the case.=20The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of t=he Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a series of material misr=epresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001,= thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifical=ly, the Complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerni=ng its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose =(i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declini=ng demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading marke=t for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market partici=pants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were= materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write-d=own the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which we=re managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron w=as failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance wi=th Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (``GAAP''). During the Class Pe=riod, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held =Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.=20On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Comp=any was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11)= loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending Se=ptember 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of t=he charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited =partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and t=hat the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder eq=uity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. When this news hit th=e market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly.=20Plaintiff is represented by the law firm of Rabin & Peckel LLP. Rabin & Pec=kel LLP and its predecessor firms have devoted its practice to shareholder =class actions and complex commercial litigation for more than thirty years =and have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for shareholders in clas=s actions throughout the United States.

The Mystery Lives On.Larry LaPrise put his right foot, as well as the rest of himself, in the grave April 4, age 83. Those who remember the exquisite torture that is the Hokey Pokey will find bittersweet news of its inventor's death. While most may remember the dance as a staple of grade-school music class, La Prise actually invented it for the ""apr?s-ski"" crowd at an Idaho resort in the 40s. The scandalous part of the story is that he almost certainly stole it. But from whom?The song was recorded as a novelty a couple of times but it didn't become a source of steady income for LaPrise until Roy Acuff bought the rights to it in the 60s.Alas, the Hokey Pokey turned out to be the high-water mark of LaPrise's musical career-in fact, the only water mark. LaPrise, by then a father of six, was working for the post office in Ketchum, Idaho.There followed a steady succession of recordings: Jack Johnson and the Hickory Dickory Singers, Warren Covington with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Cliffie Stone, Jerry Marks, Chubby Checker, Annette Funicello, the Champs. In no time, the Hokey Pokey was everywhere. Other versions include, ""Hokey Pokey Cow Bell Blues,"" ""Hokey Pokey Mama,"" and ""Hokey Pokey Polka.""By the early 1990s, it had even turned up on a heavy metal album by the band Haunted Garage, alongside such classics as ""Party in the Graveyard"" and ""Torture Dungeon"".""The Hokey Pokey' is like a square dance, really,'' LaPrise said in 1992. ""You turn around. You shake it all about. Everyone is in a circle, and it gets them all involved.''The tune became the official victory dance for the Iowa State Football team. ''''I guarantee you we never had a big victory where we were the underdog or won a championship game or had a bowl victory that we didn't do the Hokey Pokey and celebrate,'' Coach Hayden Fry said. I would have sent him a note. I'm sure he never dreamed that he made a contribution in athletics.'''But the really shocking part is that the song may have been stolen.Lexington, KY resident Bob Degen claims the folk song is his.Degen, 90, owns a 1944 copyright for ""The Hokey-Pokey Dance,"" and claims to have written the words and music. His copyright predates LaPrise's by six years.""He's a faker,"" Degen said of LaPrise. In fact, Degen sued LaPrise in 1956 in U.S. District Court in California. According to Degen, the two parties settled out of court to split 40 percent of the royalties. Degen is adamant that he wrote the song without any influences. The truth, unusually, seems to lie not in between but without: Pure Invention is rare.A December 1945 issue of Dance magazine contains an article about an English novelty song called ""the Okey Cokey,"" which American GIs were said to have danced to in England during WWII.You put your left arm in. You put your left arm out, And shake it all about. You do the okey-cokey And you turn about. And that's what it's all about."" In his 1940 book, The Gift to be Simple, Edward Deming Andrews described a song called ""The Hinkum-Booby"" that was sung by Shakers in Kentucky:""I put my right hand in,I put my right hand out, I give my right hand a shake, And I turn it all about."" So everybody in the copyright dispute was stealing from the great well of traditional folksong. As are all who try to be original with materials we hope will find resonance.Dale RasmussenTel:  (503) 464-8863 Fax: (503) 464-8058",dan.lyons@enron.com,t..hodge@enron.com,"X-To: Hodge, Jeffrey T. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhodge>",X-cc: ,Fw: Because the Hokey Pokey is more interesting than what we do for,X-bcc: ,2001-11-27 15:47:21-08:00

(ENE ) never seemed overly concerned =with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier thi=s year, the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect= documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And w=hen an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference ca=ll to produce Enron's balance sheet, Skilling called him an ""ass----."" Stil=l, even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far wit=h two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge i=nvestments. With Enron's then-chief financial officer acting as general man=ager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their= investments, the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from in=vestors seemed overwhelming. ""Internally, everybody said this is not a good= idea,"" says a source close to the company.But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation'=s largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16, when Enron reve=aled a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnershi=ps and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders' equity, the c=ompany's stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is inv=estigating Enron's accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly =disclosed them to investors.Suddenly the company, which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy= trading, is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody's Investo=rs Service has already downgraded the company's debt. Enron says it is meet=ing with credit agencies to calm their fears, and analysts say Enron is wor=king on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sale=s, issuing shares, and obtaining new credit lines. Enron's board has set up= a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analy=sts also worry that Enron's trading partners could pull the plug if they lo=se confidence that it can honor its trades.""ON CRACK?"" Inside Enron, once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still= puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the compan=y announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow, architect of the controve=rsial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials= of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a ten=se meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures, =soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1,600 employees, with ano=ther 5,000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was ""on crac=k."" Lay, an economist by training, turned over day-to-day management in 199=7. Until Skilling quit, citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron, Lay was= talking about retirement, sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight =ever. ""Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in f=lames. This is just awful,"" says one friend.On the surface, at least, Enron's off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seem=s the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly, sources close to Enron =claim that one rationale for Fastow's deals was to save an estimated $30 mi=llion a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow's involvement in the partne=rships, which bought assets from Enron, including stakes in telecom and ene=rgy, was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and =thus cheaper. They were also meant, according to sources close to the compa=ny, to hedge Enron's investments in potentially risky assets while allowing= it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for hi=mself on some of the deals, but insiders insist there were less controversi=al ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls see=king comment. Lay, who declined to comment for this story, has said that th=e partnerships were properly vetted by Enron's attorneys and internal and e=xternal auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enr=on agrees: ""We had the best lawyers in the world saying, `It looks fine.""'But whatever Enron's reasons for creating the LJM partnerships, the problem=s were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a =1999 proxy, raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer, w=hen Enron's stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring, compl=aints about LJM grew louder. So in June, Fastow pulled out of the partnersh=ips. When the write-offs came, Enron enraged analysts and investors further= by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings pre=ss release. Instead, Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. ""=We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additiona=l $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its =conference call,"" says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.BAD BETS. Still, Enron's credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts hav=e been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron ma=kes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company's =revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 a=nd its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period, Enron's ag=gressive, even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street's complaints with= impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart), the compa=ny's attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was ple=nty to worry about. The company's $3 billion power plant in India wasn't pa=ying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business= for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom= industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with A=zurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about wha=t else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren't sticking around to find out. =""I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the c=redibility of the management team,"" says Richard A. Giesen, who manages the= Munder Power Plus fund, which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.It's not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has= used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas produce=rs. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there's no particular risk =in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities, such as Whit=ewing, Osprey, Atlantic Water Trust, and Marlin Water Trust, were a way to =get assets no longer central to Enron's strategy off its balance sheet, fre=eing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broa=dband (table).To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into t=hese deals, Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren't enough =to cover debt. Such ""mandatory equity"" deals have been used by at least a h=alf-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries, including El Paso (E=PG), Williams, and Dominion, says Standard & Poor's director Todd A. Shipma=n. ""Nobody's going to find anything that's particularly unique or below boa=rd"" in such deals, says one investment banker specializing in the energy bu=siness.Worst case, which Shipman considers unlikely, Enron could be on the hook fo=r about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals. That could mean diluting =its shares by more than 25% at today's prices. Analyst John E. Olson at San=ders Morris Harris Inc. (SMHG ) figures a 9% dilution is more likely. Even =if this $3 billion in debt were included on Enron's balance sheet now, the =debt-to-capital ratio would climb to 54% from about 49% at the end of June.= Such a change would pressure Enron's credit rating but not push it below i=nvestment grade, says Shipman.HUGE HIT. Fastow's LJM, a private equity fund, was a different kind of anim=al, according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy a=nd other assets from Enron, which booked gains and losses on those deals. L=JM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the vol=atility of some of Enron's investments, including stakes in high-tech and t=elecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co., which markets power to =consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September, it took the $1.2= billion hit to equity.But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with= the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron's highly succe=ssful online platform, which trades everything from gas and electricity to =weather derivatives. To reassure its partners, Enron is scrambling to shore= up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is =trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of =massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still, ri=val traders are wary. ""We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in th=e last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk, but we'=re still doing business with the company as usual,"" says Keith G. Stamm, CE=O of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )""SPEEDING TRAIN."" Still, with the stock battered and rating agencies consid=ering further downgrades, that could rapidly change. In recent days, the un=certainty about Enron's future has reduced investors' appetite for Enron de=bt. ""No one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of surv=ival,"" says a credit-derivatives salesperson. ""It's really difficult to get= in front of a speeding train.""Even if Lay can calm his trading partners, he and his management team face =a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on Wall Street. With the= stock now hovering around $14--down from a high of $90 in August, 2000--so=me even believe that Enron could be a takeover target for the likes of GE C=apital or Royal Dutch/Shell Group. (RD ) Both declined to comment. Would En=ron sell? One source close to the company says Enron has talked about possi=ble mergers and strategic alliances in the past with Royal Dutch/Shell, amo=ng others. ""If they're really worried about liquidity, they might take the =easy way out,"" he says.If Enron does pull through this crisis, some suspect it will be a humbler, =more risk-averse place. The company that once believed it could expand its =trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities--from advertising= space to steel--will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions. That's= something some investors applaud. ""The company should focus on its strengt=hs,"" says William N. Adams, senior energy analyst at Banc of America Capita=l Management, a major shareholder. But that's a far less exciting place tha=n Enron's energy cowboys ever hoped to roam.=20By Stephanie Anderson Forest and Wendy Zellner in Dallas, with Heather Timm=ons in New YorkNOVEMBER 12, 2001=20FINANCE=20Business WeekDerivatives Danger?http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757081.htmLately, owners of Enron's (ENE) equity, bonds, and loans have been struggli=ng to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they di=dn't know about before. Now, as a fuller picture of Enron's entanglements w=ith partnerships begins to emerge, investors have something else to worry a=bout: credit default swaps, known as CDSs for short.That's financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans. Their o=wners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they h=ave if their investments go bad. The CDS market has existed only for about =two years, but it's growing fast. Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS ) and others est=imate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $1 trillion and $1.=5 trillion are covered. Not surprisingly, big banks with hefty balance shee=ts such as J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  ), Merrill Lynch (MER ), and Deutsche Ba=nk (DB ) dominate the market.Enron, however, is a player--and the only significant one that isn't also a= bank. Competitors say that although Enron has issued only between $500 mil=lion and $700 million worth of CDSs so far this year, it had ambitious plan=s to offer them online. ""They don't belong in this market,"" says one trader=. ""They don't understand the implications."" Enron did not return calls seek=ing comment.Of course, neither Enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans a=nd bonds they're insuring turn bad. Trouble is, this year is potentially a =doozie for losses on corporate debt. Corporate defaults could reach a recor=d of $100 billion, says Standard & Poor's, like BusinessWeek a unit of The =McGraw-Hill Companies. Regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $193 bi=llion by early October.If Enron has insured any of the bad debt, it might have to take charges for= losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting. With all that has =been happening in recent weeks, that's the last thing it needs.=20By Heather Timmons in New YorkNOVEMBER 12, 2001=20FINANCE=20By Mike McNameeCommentary: Enron's Clout Won't Sway the SEC=20http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757082.htmFor Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC's inv=estigation into Enron Corp. (ENE) could hardly have come at a worse time. T=he future of Pitt's ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation co=uld depend on how well he handles this case.Enron's political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create r=eal risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer, =and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President's ca=mpaign. A Bush appointee, Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He h=as made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC's enforcement, in part by rew=arding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will st=ill come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs o=f let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where m=ost cases are settled by negotiated penalties, not court-imposed fines--oft=en make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being tough or len=ient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the Enron case =is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the SEC as an=y other, less connected company.For now, top SEC aides say that's happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in Wa=shington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to shareholders= the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former= chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his fellow commissio=ners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they insist Pitt hasn'=t heard from the White House or Enron's other political allies.TOP LOBBYIST. Enron's connections are numerous. Besides Lay's links to Bush=, an Enron director, Wendy Lee Gramm, is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gra=mm, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its l=obbying budget--$2.13 million in 2000--across both parties. Just this year =it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies h=eavily because it operates in regulated industries. It notes that electric =utilities outspend it 35 to 1.On Oct. 31, a special committee of Enron's board hired William R. McLucas, =former SEC enforcement director, to represent it. McLucas should know that =any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire. Pitt, who joine=d the SEC out of law school in 1968, ""remembers how the [Nixon-era] SEC tai=nted itself by turning a blind eye to [fugitive financier] Robert Vesco,"" s=ays an agency veteran. Pitt has too much riding on the Enron probe to let i=ts connections sway his judgment.=20McNamee covers finance in Washington.",m..schmidt@enron.com,"karen.denne@enron.com, meredith.philipp@enron.com, j..kean@enron.com, ",Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii,Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable,"	vance.meyer@enron.com, pr <.palmer@enron.com>, ","X-From: Schmidt, Ann M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ASCHMID>",2001-11-02 10:07:34-08:00

"Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,I'm about to reveal a BRAND-NEW wirelessrecommendation to my subscribers, and I'm SO excitedabout this opportunity that I want to share thedetails with you, too.You see, wireless growth is simply exploding aroundthe world -- especially after the September 11terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, forexample, has skyrocketed 41% just since October1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow awhopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...andthat's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead forthis monstrous market!Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I wantto make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- geta piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'mso excited about my newest recommendation.  I expectit to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'mlooking for more incredible gains after that.  Let meshow you why.First, you might not even know about this, but therehas been an INTENSE tech competition over the lastcouple of years for the new digital wireless standard.That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!That means their proprietary technology will be usedin most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for thisstock...but keep reading, because this opportunity getsEVEN BETTER.Not only does this company get paid for every one ofits chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it alsogets paid a license fee from every single company thatwants to sell or market a cell phone based on itswinning technology.  And I'm not talking about asimple one-time fee either -- these royalties get paidon a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology isused.  One day, thanks to the strength of theirtechnology, I fully expect this company to get paidfor EVERY single cell phone in use!And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phonesubscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth inthe following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVEopportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billioncompany growing an incredible 27% per year andspending an impressive 17% of revenues on researchand development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment tofuture growth that makes me so confident they willmaintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE theirmarket space for years to come.I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourselffor years to come if you don't buy this stock now.DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!

Rowland nominates Appellate Court justiceWISCONSIN -- Verizon Wireless adds cell sites______________________________________________________FLORIDA -- Staff proposes tandem interconnect rate rulesThe Public Service Commission staff has recommended rules for determining when incumbents must pay competitive local exchange carriers the tandem-interconnection rate for reciprocal compensation.  Competitors that don't qualify for the tandem-interconnection rate are paid the cheaper end-office switching rate for reciprocal compensation. A competitor is entitled to receive the incumbent's tandem interconnection rate when its switch either ""serves a comparable geographic area to that served by an [incumbent's] tandem switch, or performs functions similar to those performed by an [incumbent's] tandem switch,"" the staff said.A competitor ""serves"" a comparable geographic area when it has deployed a switch and has opened ""NXXs"" to serve the exchanges within the area, the staff said.  The staff rejected BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.'s and Verizon Florida, Inc.'s argument that competitors must ""serve"" actual customers within a comparable geographic area.  FCC rules permit competitors to qualify for the tandem interconnection rate if they serve ""a comparable geographic area, not a comparable customer base within this area,"" the staff said.A ""comparable geographic area"" includes an area that is ""roughly the same size in comparison but not necessarily identical"" to the area served by an incumbent's tandem switch, the staff said.  Similar functionality is trunk-to-trunk switching, the staff said.  The commission is scheduled to vote on the staff's recommendation Dec. 5.  (Docket 000075-TP)______________________________________________________ARIZONA -- Cable TV providers to link networksA group of about 11 cable TV providers operating in Arizona have established a consortium called First Mile Arizona to link up their networks.  The consortium was launched by Cox Communications, Inc., the state's largest cable TV operator, in cooperation with the Arizona Cable Television Association (ACTA).  ACTA Executive Director Susan Bitter Smith told TR that the consortium consisted of large and midsize cable TV companies that use combinations of hard wire and microwave facilities to serve their customers.  She said the first link of the statewide network would be activated in the eastern part of Arizona during first-quarter 2002.  She added that connecting the northern part of the state would be the next milestone.The statewide network plan stemmed from an ASP (application service provider) contract Cox was awarded by the state.  Under the $28 million contract, Cox will provide ASP services to state school facilities, which includes close to one million users, a staff member from the Arizona Telecommunications & Information Council (ATIC) told TR.  The contact also obliged Cox to deliver these services statewide although the company doesn't offer services everywhere in the state.  The consortium will help Cox fulfill its contract with the state by providing a network for its ASP services.  Ms. Bitter Smith said the consortium plans to do more than just providing ASP services to the school systems.  She added that the consortium may help bring cable TV services to unserved parts of the state.______________________________________________________TEXAS -- Small ILECs oppose CPNI 'win-back' restrictionsThe Texas Statewide Telephone Cooperative, Inc., has asked the Public Utility Commission to eliminate a rule prohibiting telecom carriers from using a former customer's CPNI (customer proprietary network information) to ""win back"" customers who have switched their service to another provider.  The PUC has proposed revising its CPNI rules to make them consistent with recent changes to FCC rules.  (10/22/01)  The PUC requested comments on whether the FCC's rules permit telecom providers to use a former customer's CPNI to ""win back"" customers.  The FCC's rules permit carriers to use a former customer's CPNI to regain that customer's business, the cooperative said.  The cooperative represents 19 telecom cooperatives and 16 small commercially owned telecom companies.  (Project 22490)______________________________________________________NEW YORK -- PSC mulls putting UNE rate case on holdThe Public Service Commission has asked for comments by Nov. 28 discussing whether its unbundled network element (UNE) rate case should be postponed for a limited time.  The PSC staff filed comments last week asking that the UNE case be held in abeyance ""to permit the parties in the two captioned proceedings to fashion a comprehensive resolution. . .through a negotiated process.""  (Case 00-C-1945 and 98-C-1357)______________________________________________________DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC sets carrier-to-carrier guidelinesThe Public Service Commission has adopted new carrier-to-carrier (C2C) guidelines based on a Verizon Washington, D.C., Inc., proposed model.  The C2C guidelines measure Verizon's performance in providing operations support systems and other services to competitive local exchange carriers.The new guidelines are based on metrics adopted last year by the New York Public Service Commission, but they were modified to ""reflect systems and conditions in the District of Columbia that varied from those in New York.""  (12/19/00)  The new guidelines are in effect now, but plans related to the C2C reporting requirements and performance assurance plans, which were submitted by Verizon and AT&T Corp., are under still under consideration by the PSC.  (Case 990, In the Matter of the Development of Local Exchange Carrier Quality of Service Standards for the District, Order 12230)______________________________________________________CALIFORNIA -- ALJ sets hearings on state LD entry requirementsA Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has scheduled hearings for Dec. 3-5 to discuss Pacific Bell's compliance with the instate interLATA (local access and transport area) market-entry requirements in the California code.  Section 709.2 directs the PUC to find that permitting Pacific Bell to enter the California interLATA market poses no substantial harm to the interexchange market.  The commission also must find that Pacific Bell's entry is based on fully open local exchange access and that the company isn't engaging in anticompetitive behavior or improper cross-subsidization.  (5/7/01)The ALJ said she set the hearings because several parties requested them.  The ALJ limited the parties to only presenting arguments that highlight the central points of their written comments, which were submitted in August.  She said no new evidence could be presented and parties that didn't submit comments therefore won't be able to participate in the hearings.The hearings will begin with a presentation by Pacific Bell.  The other parties will respond in accordance with their August comments, and Pacific Bell will have an opportunity to reply.  Parties interested in arguing more than one issue must send a list to the ALJ by Nov. 28.  (Rulemakings 93-04-003 and 95-04-043 and Investigations 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)______________________________________________________ARKANSAS -- SBC begins offering LD serviceSBC Long Distance, a Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. affiliate, today began offering long distance service to residential and business customers in Arkansas.  SBC already offers long distance service in Connecticut, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.Residential customers who pay no monthly fee will pay 10 cents-per-minute for interstate long distance calls and 12 cents-per-minute for intrastate long distance calls.  Customers who pay a $4.95 monthly fee qualify for a 7 cents-per-minute rate for interstate and intrastate long distance calls.  Customers may also pay $24.95 per month for 500 minutes of long distance service, which equals about 5 cents-per-minute.  Calls that exceed the 500-minute threshold are billed at 7 cents-per-minute.Business customers that subscribe to the company's local and long distance service qualify for a 7 cents-per-minute rate for interstate long distance calls and a 9 cents-per-minute rate for intrastate long distance calls.  Businesses that spend more than $50 a month on long distance service are charged 6-8.9 cents-per-minute for switched long distance service and 4.2-7 cents-per-minute for dedicated long distance service.  The rate depends on the customer's call volume and term commitment.  The FCC authorized SBC to offer interLATA (local access and transport area) long distance services in Missouri and Arkansas beginning Nov. 26.  SBC's application to provide long distance service in Missouri is pending before the Missouri Public Service Commission, which is scheduled to vote on it Nov. 27.______________________________________________________SOUTH DAKOTA -- Telecom complaints top listThe Public Utilities Commission has received more than 164 telecom complaints since its Nov. 8 meeting, compared to about 21 electricity complaints and 16 natural gas complaints.The telecom complaints included billing issues, telemarketing concerns, unauthorized billing, poor service, increased telephone rates, and ""slamming.""  Slamming is the unauthorized switch of a customer's telecom carrier.The PUC received 2,721 consumer complaints during 2001 and addressed or resolved 2,571.______________________________________________________TEXAS -- American Lightwave rolls out national, reverse DAAmerican Lightwave Communications, Inc., has started offering its local service customers national and reverse directory assistance for $1.25 per call.

(11/05/2001)The disputed issues include (1) whether either party should be required to install more than one point of interconnection per LATA (local access and transport area), (2) whether each party should be responsible for the costs associated with transporting telecom traffic to the single point of interconnection, (3) whether Sprint's calling area boundaries should be imposed on Global NAPs, and (4) whether Global NAPs can assign its customers ""NXX"" codes that are ""homed"" in a central office switch outside of a customer's local calling area.  Both companies and the PUC staff must file testimony by Dec. 4  (Docket 01-10018)______________________________________________________MICHIGAN -- PSC mulls Westphalia TSLRIC studyThe Public Service Commission has asked for comments by Dec. 28 on Westphalia Telephone Co.'s proposed total-service long-run incremental cost (TSLRIC) model, which was filed Nov. 2.  The commission asked parties to comment on the proposed TSLRIC metrics.  Replies are due Jan. 9, 2002.  (Case U-13177)______________________________________________________ALASKA -- Cable Co. wants to exit marketThe Cable Co., Inc., has asked the Regulatory Commission of Alaska for authority to abandon its cable TV service area in Aniak.  The company said it has attempted to sell the utility, but added that it was ""improbable"" that such a sale would be consummated because of declining demand for cable TV service in the Aniak area.Comments on the request are due Dec. 21.

Our acquisition of Kiss.=com has been very successful adding significant critical mass and helping u=s become the 2nd largest business in the sector. Our growth this year has m=ade us a formidable contender for the number one slot during 2002. As our b=usiness model becomes more established it is our belief that the business w=ill reach an EBITDA to Revenue margin of around 50%.""""Today we have around 175,000 paying subscribers, the market leader Match.c=om owned by Ticketmaster had approximately 250,000 subscribers at the end o=f September 2001. This year it is our understanding that uDate, Match and m=any of the other top 10 businesses in this sector have experienced good to =strong growth in subscribers. The absence of any significant competitive pr=essures and the perception that the growth is accelerating in absolute term=s leads us to conclude that the market sector as a whole is growing at a si=gnificant rate. Our guidance figures indicate that our subscriber base will= be around 215,000 by December 31, 2001, 420,000 by December 2002 and 700,0=00 by December 2003.""""This is a sector where the size of subscriber base has significant impact =on a company's ability to grow the business and achieve profitability. Many= companies who have entered this space have failed to achieve critical mass= and/or profitability. Examples include well financed start-ups like Social=Net who raised around $20M. Recently, Yahoo.com launched a subscription bas=ed personals service. However, in preparation for this Yahoo rejected adver=tising orders from competitive Online Personals services including uDate fr=om the early in July 2001. This has had little tangible impact on the growt=h of our business as advertising contracts were easily replaced with equal =or better performing channels. The market should also recognize that Yahoo =had been operating in this market sector for a long time offering a free se=rvice. Their move to a subscription based model was therefore welcomed.""""There are a number of key factors driving growth in this sector including =greater awareness of Online Personals and better understanding of what it i=s and is not; repeat users returning to Online Personals when a relationshi=p ends; greater critical mass of the top services leading to a more success=ful and compelling experience; greater acceptance of online subscription se=rvices; and improved use and availability of PC and digital camera technolo=gy.

With final bids due on January 7th, my target is to close and fund the sale by the end of January. When the sale closes, Enron will be out of Korea and no longer need my services here. As a bit of background, about one year ago , I needed to get my daughter back into the United States for medical and educational reasons ,so I repatriated my family to Orlando , Florida. At that time ,I (or anyone else) could have forecast the events that have taken place within Enron.		Stan thought there might be something for me to do in Maitland , and I told him I would be interested in that or Houston for that matter. I had to leave Houston on Saturday to get back here, but I would like to give you a call to see if there is anything I could do in your organization.",w..kinder@enron.com,phil.lowry@enron.com,"X-From: Kinder, Darrell W. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DKINDER1>","X-To: Lowry, Phil </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Plowry2>",Darrell Kinder Repatriation,"X-cc: McCarty, Danny </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dmccarty>",2001-11-18 22:58:17-08:00
"Thursday December 20 5:39 AM ET Bids Open for Enron Trading UnitBy KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion. Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit. Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion. Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10. Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books. The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies. In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline. Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November. Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline. Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York. U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy. Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection. ``It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit. ``If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision. Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after Enron filed one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history Dec. 2 and sued Dynegy for $10 billion for breach of contract in New York. Dynegy and other creditors also have asked that the bankruptcy case be moved to Houston, where Enron, Dynegy and many of Enron's 800 or so creditors are based. Gonzalez will consider those requests Jan. 7. Also Wednesday, nearly 40 of some 4,500 Enron employees laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy gathered outside Enron headquarters here to discuss the company's severance policy and sign a complaint to Enron on the lack of information. Some carried signs that displayed the word ``Moron'' under Enron's logo and said ``What were they thinking?'' Others wore T-shirts that said ``The Execs Who Stole Christmas.'' Gonzalez on Dec. 4 $1.5 billion in short-term financing to keep the company afloat and fund $4,500 severance payments. Former workers received those checks last week, but revelations that nearly 600 employees deemed critical to Enron's survival received more than $100 million in retention payments upset those entitled to more money under Enron's severance policy, they said. The company's severance policy says eligible workers are entitled to a week's pay for each full or partial year of employment and another week's pay for each $10,000 they earned in salary, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. ``We would like the company to honor its commitment,'' said Pete Chase, 31, who worked for Enron Energy Services for 18 months. Denne said the company cannot approve any severance payments above $4,500 for each employee without Gonzalez' approval. Employees can file claims with the judge for more severance pay. Instructions on how to do so are available on Enron's Web site (www.enron.com). ``The next step for Enron is for its creditors to assess its financial condition and assets,'' Denne said. ``Every employee is absolutely free to file a claim.'' Enron, formerly No. 7 on the Fortune 500 with stock trading near $90 a year ago, plummeted into bankruptcy after revelations of hidden debt and overstated earnings in October siphoned investor confidence and prompted traders to flee from what was once the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas. Dynegy abandoned a plan to buy Enron for $8.4 billion when it continued to reveal serious financial problems and Enron's credit was downgraded to junk. Dynegy shares rose $3.08 to close at $23.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron shares were down 6 cents to 44 cents, also on the NYSE.",legal <.hall@enron.com>,center.dl-portland@enron.com,,,Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit,"\ExMerge - Solberg, Geir\Inbox",2001-12-20 08:09:12-08:00
"Hello KenAs we have not had a recent ""daily update"" from you - I write inquiring about the status of OUR company.We heard about the acquisition discussions with Dynegy through the press (NOT from Enron's management!).  Clearly, this does not engender confidence in the management's communication philosophy.We also heard that there is a meeting planned with Enron's banks on Friday - again through the press!  Communication failed again.Further reductions in confidence came as Enron restated it's financial statements for the period 1997 through 2000.  Again this news was provided by the press!Couple of questions for you - who were the commercial folks putting together the LJM, Chewco etc. deals?  Who were senior managers approving these deals?  Perhaps Enron should part company with some of those folks too.  Where was the board and where were you when these deals were being done?  There appears to have been no corporate governance at the relevant periods!On a personal level, I have invested many years in this company.  I currently have a holding of approx. 4,500 shares which I purchased because I believed in the company.  I also have numerous share options.  Unfortunately, this episode has obliterated my confidence in management and in particular in you and Jeff Skilling.  I suspect you guys are ok - as you had the foresight (knowledge?) to cash out your holding during the latter part of last year and most of this year.Please be aware that the fate of thousands of people rests in your hands.I would be interested to hear your views.Amita GosaliaTel: +44 20 7783 5466",amita.gosalia@enron.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,,,Update for Wednesday/Thursday?,"\KLAY (Non-Privileged)\Lay, Kenneth\Inbox",2001-11-08 10:29:54-08:00

"Mr Lay,To suggest that I am merely disappointed by Enron'sperformance in both the public markets and the broadercorporate universe is an understatement.Enron is at a crossroads with one path leading toirrelevance assigned to companies unable to rise inthe face of crisis, and the other path being reservedfor those that not only survive, but come outstronger. I'm sure you can easily identify examples ofeach without my help.Every individual in management and oversight (theBoard of Directors) shares the blame andresponsibility to take drastic action and come clean.Enron now has a higher bar of corporate governancethan other publicly traded companies due to thereckless squandering of trust that resulted fromactions of many individuals who believed they wereclever and crafty, or just plain greedy. Furthermore,I strongly suggest to you that many senior managerswithin the corporate suites of Enron no longer have aplace in the company, quite possibly that may includeyourself. A clean break and a thorough cleaning isclearly required.In years past, when asked about the companies that Iadmired and watched, Enron always was on the shortlist.

Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=e.=20I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with= the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a= believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=d on to those valuable options.Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us= that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the= goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,= +/- 20%. =20Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their= entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and= the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees= and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=horts have ruined so many lives.

"Mr. Lay:First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 yea=rs now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of m=y life, career-wise.  When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost sta=rry eyed.  I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates=t company I had ever been associated with.  I started out with Enron Power =Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible.I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years.  Some great, some good and= some not so good.  But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart= beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our =management have made.  But most of all, we've still got great people.  Base=d on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like= we are going to have to ""do it all over again"".  However, I am an eternal =optimist.  Looking at this in football terms...  this is a rebuilding year =and we've got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench.One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich =Kinder exuded.  I was saddened to see Mr. Kinder move on, but I was confide=nt that having you remain behind would continue our successes.  And we have= been successful.  Aside from the LJM issue (which, to be honest, I still d=on't fully understand), I think we've just had some external distractions t=hat have hampered our stock growth this year, such as Dabhol, Portland Gene=ral, California, etc., in addition to the market conditions in general. =20In the all-employee meeting, you told the troops that it was going to take =the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going i=n the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess.  I am full=y prepared to do this, however, there is one request I would like to bring =up.  I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are goi=ng to expire at the end of this year.  In all my wildest dreams (or nightma=res), I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threate=n a grant price of $21.563, but here we are.  As a dedicated and confident =employee, I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications= around me that the stock would go to 100.  Later in the year, as the stock= moved downward, I heard indications that we were going to bounce back stro=ng.  I was on board.  I was excited.  I trusted that this was the case.  In= fact, I look back on this past year and, based on what I knew at the time,= I would probably do the same thing over again.But...   that was then and this is now.  It has been painful for me, as I k=now it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company.  I wan=t to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end. =20My request is simple...    is there any way possible to extend options expi=ring at the end of this year by one year?If you want to make a good faith gesture towards long-time employees who ar=e willing to re-dedicate themselves to the daunting task at hand, I can thi=nk of nothing better for the short term.   I think extending the expiration= date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee popu=lation who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourse=lves in. =20If you can't do anything, I will understand.

"Dear Ken,Today I learned that effective midnight tonight I have been made redundant from my position in Enron Europe. I have worked for Enron for the last 10 years and I can say that despite what has happened today, joining Enron was the best career move I made. The past 10 years have presented opportunities that were beyond my wildest dreams. I appreciate everything that Enron has done for myself and my family, and I leave believing that I did my best to return my gratefulness in some way. While growing up in a worling class environment my father taught me two great lessons in life, which I believe we all need to learn. The first being that if you ever want anything in life then you had better work for it. The second being that you should never understand the meaning of the word ""can't"". I believe that I have been able to follow his teaching in my career with Enron.I leave Enron with tremendous experience and, most of all a feeling of belonging to something that was once great. I truly believed in the company and its people. Indeed I have reminded myself daily over the last few weeks that Enrons success was built more on its intangible assets rather than its tangible assets.

That way, the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues.  Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already.  I might be missing something, but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos - equity method investment (as shown), or consolidated with 50% minority interests.  In the former case our debt holdings are understated, and in the latter they're overstated.  My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown.  In terms of capex, currently I have TW picking up 50% of the capex (starting equity basis).  Not to be flip, but I'm not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs.  If we had an undivided interest we would have 50% of the deal on our books, debt and all.Please let me know which method I should use. 2) The equity balance did not seem to change for the $137,500,000 equity infusion.     Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment? There was $184mm in excess cash that was dividended back out.  The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debt/equity ratio to 50% after the infusion.   It would seem to me that if there was 137,500,000 coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt, so where did the excess cash come from? 3) Let's grow Other Taxes by 1%   Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant.   For most pipes these are property/earnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form 2 for the most part.I need to fix the model to make ""other taxes"" a function of ppe.  I'll make it a constant rate based on year 1.  Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts - I'll go back to the  planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion.    Also a part is payroll taxes.    Tracy could probably break it apart for you.4) Question for TG, Reg Am was only $7.6 million in 2002 but $16.5 million going forward.   All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case. that's why we had to increase it so much - so that it amortizes to zero by 2006.  Note that it is non-cash, non-tax, but it represents a large reduction in equity.    Then there must be a problem elsewhere, since it is supposed to be gone by itself.5) Question for LD/SH on the 2006 drop in revenues by approx. $15 million.  Detail schedules show why, just want to make sure it makes sense.That's an item that Lindy's following up on, but probably the whole group needs to consider.  Our fuel retention goes away after '06, the question is whether ""max rates"" should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not.  The interpretation in the model is that ""max rates"" means our max published reservation fee only, meaning that we lose $15mm of fuel retention after '06.    If we are at max rates, then that would be the result, however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number.6) ROE questions/cases -	Let's show after ROE, the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov. 2001.  This obviously dropped the ROE from 12-13% to 10%.  If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW (it should not have been there in the first place!), the ROE will be much higher.  In addition, reducing equity by the $137,500,000 should also improve the ROE substantially.    ?I'll run a line that adds back tax-adjusted interest expense in the ROE calc, the $137.5mm was handled as above.   This is not intuitive.   The ROE should be bigger with debt, unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt.

It's really quite simple. Ismail is a successfulmule trader in Peshawar. Every year Ismail delivers 30 mules to the KabulMule Market and gets $40 per mule.This year, however, the Khyber Pass is full of warlord militias, so Ismailis not sure he can drive his mules to market without losing a mule here andthere. Also, the demand for mules in Kabul seems to be dropping. Maybehe'llonly be able to sell 20 mules, or, God forbid, 15, and then be forced tofeed and water the rest of them on a money-losing trek back home. In otherwords, it's a scary market and Ismail is worried about feeding his family.What Ismail needs is to limit his risk with an Enron derivatives package.First he pays $2 per mule for a Khyber Pass Derivative, so that any mulekilled or stolen by warlords will be reimbursed at the rate of $20 permule-half the going market rate, but still better than taking a total loss.Next he buys Enron Mule Futures. For $28 per contract, he guaranteesdelivery of a mule in three months time. He takes 15 of these, figuringthata guaranteed $28 mule sale is better than showing up in Kabul anddiscovering that the mule buyers have been killed by stray bombs.Meanwhile, at the Enron Mule Trading Desk in Houston, eagle-eyed yuppiesarestudying the worldwide mule markets and starting to have their doubts aboutthose $28 delivery contracts. Mule use is dropping all over Afghanistan,even as the mule count is dwindling. Better resell eight of those 15contracts to a European commodities broker for $24 each, then make up that$32 loss somewhere else while cutting the company's exposure in half. Buthow to hedge the risk on the other seven?Aha! A blip on the computer screen. A temporary mule shortage in southernIran! With a current mule price of $42 in Tehran, Enron could offer aLinkedMule Swap Double Derivative tied to the gap between the price of mulesdelivered in Kabul on a given date and the price in Tehran on the samedate.Sure, you would rather have the quick-and-clean Iran sale, instead of thesale in Kabul that requires trucking the mules to a foreign market. Butevenif you add in $4 per mule for transport through militia-held territory andaveraged the markets together, you can still clear eight bucks just on thegap alone.Enron's average price-per-future-mule is now $32.57 when you include the$4-per-mule loss on the mule futures dumped in Europe. But based on theamazing $12 Kabul/Tehran trading gap, they can easily put together a""delivery in either market"" contract that will allow them to ask $36 permule on their Mule Online Internet trading system. The first mule futuresells instantly for $36, and the price bobs up to $36.50. Two mules go for$36.75, and then there's a big jump for the last three mules to $37.90.Enron has now off-loaded all its price-based mule futures liability for aprofit of $31.70.But this doesn't mean they're out of the mule market in Central Asia. It'sstill two months until Ismail delivers his 30 mules, and Enron is on thehook for his Khyber Pass derivative insurance policy.Things are not looking good in that part of the world, either. The chancesof a mule being picked off as a road-passage tax are pretty high, and theloss of the whole herd would be a $600 liability. Quickly, the financialboys go to work, and part of that liability is resold to a consortium ofSingapore banks, Australian mutual funds, and Saudi Arabian arms merchantAdnan Kashoggi, thereby reducing Enron's percentage to 25 percent, or $150in potential liability against a $15 premium (remember the $2 per mule paidby Ismail), and Enron also takes a brokerage fee of $20 from the threeotherpartners, thereby reducing its real liability to just $120.But that's still too much of a spread, so Enron continues to hedge.Fortunately, the company has such a diversified trading floor that Enronmule-market experts can walk over to the traders in the warlord-militiaderivatives department. Sure enough, at least four tribes near the KhyberPass are increasingly concerned about profit margins. There simply aren'tenough people to rob. Things have gotten so bad, in fact, that the warlordsare hedging against the oncoming winter by taking futures positions instolen chickens, stolen humanitarian aid trucks, and Western hostages.There's not a mule market yet, because the warlords have successfullyconverted many of the recalcitrant villagers into pack animals. But Enronknows how to MAKE markets.Quickly the numbers-crunchers go to work, and they soon determine that theaverage number of stolen mules per 100-man militia is 1.4 per year. Thatrepresents anywhere from $28 to $56 in lost mule-thievery income if theKhyber Pass is closed or inhospitable to traders from Pakistan. Amortizingthat amount over 12 months, the warlords have an exposure of anywhere from$2.33 to $4.67 per month in lost pillage. Hence Enron announces the newHighway Robbery Derivative, in which each tribe is guaranteed the value oftwo stolen mules in each 12-month period in return for paying a premium of$4 per month.Enron's hedge is now complete, and it's a beautiful thing to behold. Thechances of Ismail losing a mule to a raiding party are approximately one in30, or 3.33 percent. Since he's paying $60 for his derivative contract, theexpected loss of 3.33 percent of his herd would result in a payment of only$20 ? a more than comfortable spread. Meanwhile, if the mule is stolen by awarlord holding a Highway Robbery Derivative, then the payment to the otherside would only be $28 against premiums of $48. If Ismail simply passesthrough the Khyber Pass without incident and sells all his mules at thestandard price, Enron pockets $60 from Ismail and $48 each from fourwarlords, in addition to the previous profit of $31.70 from that headyInternet mule-futures trading day and the $20 in packaging commissions. Ifeach warlord steals his standard 1.4 mules per year, then Enron still owessix-tenths of one mule to the warlord, or about $22.20 based on a $37 saleprice.Total expected profit, based on 5.6 stolen mules, one of which is stolenfrom Ismail: $143.20. Total profit from all Ismail-related muletransactions: $194.90. See, it's simple when you know how it works.

Despite Enron's collapse, its goalof merging the best thinking in energy, finance andinformation technology as an online commodity trader stillgarners respect. ""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basicvirtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chiefexecutive and research director of the META Group(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""Thereis still a real market for virtual trading companies, noquestion about it."" Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,later, other products like rights to high-speedtelecommunications networks and financial hedges againstchanges in the weather. It used a sophisticated onlineplatform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge thecompany's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst whofollows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the companyhad ""the pioneering online venture for real-timeavailability of information"" used in trading commodities. *  Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yetserve as a model for other companies. In the wake ofEnron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support forthat model model came from its competitors. Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companiesthat followed Enron in offering online exchanges forelectricity and natural gas. ""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enronwent away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chiefoperating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. ""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayedbasically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of oneintermediary just proves that these competitive marketswork."" Other companies offering similar services rushed to fillthe gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked upmarket share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremelyimportant and a big income earner for us, is not thecenterpiece of our business."" Another company that sees continued value in the Enronapproach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, whichbought Enron's electricity and gas trading business inbankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under itsown brand. ""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" DavidWalker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-ratetrading platform."" Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivativesbusiness and Enron's trading of energy contracts were onefactor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""Thecharacteristics of trading these types of products andbetting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had""outstanding"" information technology organization that wasbacked by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way aswell, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to thebest financial companies out there."" Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnickpredicted, UBS would have little difficulty regainingEnron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that itshouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a coupleseconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a marketinefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" According to experts who consulted for Enron in the fieldof finance, the company did not necessarily come up with alot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizingexisting ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. ""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in thecontext of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, aprofessor of finance at the University of Texas who onceconsulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they weredoing."" Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.He said the company needed advanced financial tools toprice its derivatives, which specified energy products tobe delivered at various times and sites while demand wasuncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probablybreaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" hesaid. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe andmay be hard to do."" Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business Schoolwho studied Enron, said the company had been using whatwould be considered ""best practices"" for using derivativesby any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, itmight still survive today. ""Enron could have done extremely well with betting onmarket inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""Peoplestop hedging because they get too enamored of their owntheories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term CapitalManagement, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when itcould no longer cover the ever-higher risks it begantaking. Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, bythrowing money at ventures that failed to generate cashflow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on itsnetwork capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which neverturned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demiselike a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts ofthis story."" But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online tradingsystem to products beyond electricity and natural gas mightnot rule out future, similar endeavors. ""In any commodity, there are always people who have toomuch and others who have too little, so there's alwaysgoing to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""Professor Tufano said. Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simplyill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" hesaid. He noted that the deregulation of electricity andnatural gas led to a long period during which the marketfor energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It doestake a while before users of a commodity get comfortablewith the idea that they should risk-manage and out-sourcetheir use of that commodity."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/28/business/28NECO.html?ex=1013231198&ei=1&en=b419a4892b911727HOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact Alyson Racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

Despite Enron's collapse, its goalof merging the best thinking in energy, finance andinformation technology as an online commodity trader stillgarners respect. ""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basicvirtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chiefexecutive and research director of the META Group(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""Thereis still a real market for virtual trading companies, noquestion about it."" Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,later, other products like rights to high-speedtelecommunications networks and financial hedges againstchanges in the weather. It used a sophisticated onlineplatform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge thecompany's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst whofollows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the companyhad ""the pioneering online venture for real-timeavailability of information"" used in trading commodities. *  Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yetserve as a model for other companies. In the wake ofEnron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support forthat model model came from its competitors. Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companiesthat followed Enron in offering online exchanges forelectricity and natural gas. ""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enronwent away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chiefoperating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. ""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayedbasically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of oneintermediary just proves that these competitive marketswork."" Other companies offering similar services rushed to fillthe gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked upmarket share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremelyimportant and a big income earner for us, is not thecenterpiece of our business."" Another company that sees continued value in the Enronapproach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, whichbought Enron's electricity and gas trading business inbankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under itsown brand. ""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" DavidWalker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-ratetrading platform."" Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivativesbusiness and Enron's trading of energy contracts were onefactor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""Thecharacteristics of trading these types of products andbetting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had""outstanding"" information technology organization that wasbacked by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way aswell, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to thebest financial companies out there."" Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnickpredicted, UBS would have little difficulty regainingEnron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that itshouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a coupleseconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a marketinefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" According to experts who consulted for Enron in the fieldof finance, the company did not necessarily come up with alot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizingexisting ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. ""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in thecontext of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, aprofessor of finance at the University of Texas who onceconsulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they weredoing."" Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.He said the company needed advanced financial tools toprice its derivatives, which specified energy products tobe delivered at various times and sites while demand wasuncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probablybreaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" hesaid. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe andmay be hard to do."" Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business Schoolwho studied Enron, said the company had been using whatwould be considered ""best practices"" for using derivativesby any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, itmight still survive today. ""Enron could have done extremely well with betting onmarket inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""Peoplestop hedging because they get too enamored of their owntheories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term CapitalManagement, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when itcould no longer cover the ever-higher risks it begantaking. Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, bythrowing money at ventures that failed to generate cashflow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on itsnetwork capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which neverturned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demiselike a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts ofthis story."" But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online tradingsystem to products beyond electricity and natural gas mightnot rule out future, similar endeavors. ""In any commodity, there are always people who have toomuch and others who have too little, so there's alwaysgoing to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""Professor Tufano said. Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simplyill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" hesaid. He noted that the deregulation of electricity andnatural gas led to a long period during which the marketfor energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It doestake a while before users of a commodity get comfortablewith the idea that they should risk-manage and out-sourcetheir use of that commodity."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/28/business/28NECO.html?ex=1013231198&ei=1&en=b419a4892b911727HOW TO ADVERTISE---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact Alyson Racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

Please let me know if there are any questions.Gary was unable to find any information in the TSIA that outlined the procedure that we currently use to record maintenance time of 4 hours per month instead of recording the time as it is used. Gary had a conversation with Mike Kelly whom assured him that this has not been done in the past and seems to be an incorrect way to report the maintenance time. Gary also stated that this would lead to error in availability in months were there were 28 days in the month compared to a month with 31 daysMark Howller & Mike Kelly have also conveyed to Gary that using 10 min data to calculate estimated power production and availability was an industry standard. In an attempt to complete the sale of the site, Zilkha has been asked to provide 10 minute data to their potential customers. Grays questions is why are we not using the 10 minute data files to calculate our availability.Gary also wanted to know how the Mon.db file could be more accurate then the Minana.db file, if the Mon.db file is taking samples from other files, and the other files have missing data like the Minana.db does. He also wanted to know how the Mon.db file could be verified if there happened to be a mistake as there appears to be on turbine 9 for the month of April. Where is the raw data proving the numbers in the Mon.db file.We also discussed the faults on turbine 4 for the month of April. Gary stated that the faults he outlined in his letter came from the errordev.db file. He was unaware of the state of the turbine at the time of the faults or if they contributed to down time or not. I am researching this and will inform you as soon as I know.Gary also per warned me of an Email that is planning to go out to Mike Miller. The letter states that over the past 6 months our turbines have performed poorly, and we have attempted to mislead them by over stating out availability. We have also misstated the amount of parts used on site and we have not explained problems to Zilkha, that we are experiencing with our turbines. He also states that we have not provided maintenance's to our turbines in the last 7 months.",mark.walker@enron.com,mark.fisher@enron.com,,,Conversation with Gary,\mark fischer 7-12-02\Notes Folders\All documents,2002-06-11 02:46:00-07:00

"X-Origin: FARMER-DX-FileName: darren farmer 6-26-02.pstNGI's Daily Gas Price Index Breaking News : posted Jan 9, 2:28 PMDynegy Not Opposed to Enron Auction; Senate Subcommittee to Issue 51 Subpoenas Nearly 20 of bankrupt Enron Corp.'s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company's trading assets this week, but one-time merger partner and creditor Dynegy Corp. will not be one of them, a spokesman said Wednesday. However, whether the auction proceeds as planned, Enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued Friday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for Enron's trading business, once the most profitable unit of the company. The motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale. Included in the auction are assets from its EnronOnline operation, which Enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash-rich company. Under Enron's proposal, a 51% joint venture partner would form a new company with Enron to be called New Energy Trading Co., or NETCO. Enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things, in exchange for a 49% stake. As of late Monday, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and BP had made bids for some of the assets. Among those opposing the auction, now set for Thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as Friday, is the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, which said, ""Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate, appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries."" Kansas City, MO-based Aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used. Aquila wants the auction's proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of Enron receive the money. However, Dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction, said company spokesman Steve Stengel, who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it. ""Dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of Enron's trading business,"" he told NGI. Stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of Northern Natural Gas Co. from Enron to Dynegy is still set to close by the end of January. Still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The subpoenas will be served on Enron, its accounting firm Andersen and 49 individual officers, employees and members of the board of directors. The subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice. ""The subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members, the role of the auditors, and the role of special-purpose entities,"" a subcommittee spokesman told Reuters. These are some of the same types of things being investigated by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, the Senate Commerce Committee and the House and Senate Energy committees. The spokesman said the subpoenas would allow Enron and the others ""several weeks"" to respond.",suzanne.calcagno@enron.com,"robert.superty@enron.com, tammy.jaquet@enron.com, victor.lamadrid@enron.com, ","X-From: Calcagno, Suzanne </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SCALCAGN>","X-To: Superty, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rsupert>, Jaquet, Tammy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tjaquet>, Lamadrid, Victor </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Vlamadr>, Kinsey, Lisa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lkinsey>, Sullivan, Patti </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Psulliv>, Steffes, James D. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jsteffe>, Farmer, Daren J. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dfarmer>, #99 Tech Support, </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=6dc63ad-f586aeb5-862566ef-6eede6>","	lisa.kinsey@enron.com, patti.sullivan@enron.com, ",X-cc: ,2002-01-09 13:46:10-08:00

"X-FileName: scott neal 6-26-02.PSTNGI's Daily Gas Price Index Breaking News : posted Jan 16, 9:52 AMDominion '01 Earnings Exceed Estimates Despite $348M 4Q Charges Dominion said Wednesday its 2001 operating earnings, excluding special charges, are expected to ""meet or slightly exceed"" analyst expectations of $4.15 per share, and it reaffirmed its 2002 earnings guidance of $4.90-4.95 per share. The higher earnings come despite fourth quarter write-downs of about $348 million, created by $97 million related to Enron Corp. exposure, a write-down of Dominion Capital assets worth $183 million, and a restructuring initiative announced in November, which will cost $68 million. The Richmond, VA-based integrated energy company said the Enron charge is ""related to credit exposure on past energy sales to Enron for which payment has not yet been received,"" totaling $6 million, and the ""impaired value of forward natural gas contracts with Enron,"" worth $91 million. Dominion said the Enron charges are non-cash, and with the fourth quarter charge, the company ""substantially eliminates any further Enron-related earnings exposure going forward."" Dominion has hedged more than 60% of its expected 2002 gas volumes and has hedged about 40% of its expected 2003 gas volumes at prices ""significantly"" above current market prices. Because of the hedging program and cost-cutting initiatives, Dominion said it is ""positioned to exceed the consensus analyst estimate of $4.89 per share in 2002 and to grow earnings thereafter at an average annual rate of 10%."" ""The Enron bankruptcy was the industry's equivalent of a 'thousand-year flood',"" said CEO Thomas E. Capps. ""The floodwaters are receding. As a result of some very costly but important lessons learned, the industry will be financially stronger overall. However, the Enron collapse has set in motion and accelerated a badly needed weeding-out process in the industry. The strong will get stronger and the weak will get weaker."" Capps said a ""handful"" of ""financially strong, asset-heavy and integrated industry leaders, including Dominion, are already benefiting from a 'flight to quality' as energy users seek out suppliers they know they can count on to be there when the energy is needed."" Another write-down, for Dominion Capital, is related to the value of its assets and increased loan loss reserves. When Dominion completed its merger with CNG in January 2000, it became a registered company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), which prohibits registered companies from engaging in business not functionally related to the energy business. To comply with PUHCA, Dominion had to divest Dominion Capital, its financial services business, within a defined period, ""which happened to overlap a recession."" The company said it anticipates no other Dominion Capital asset write-downs or loan loss reserve adjustments. ""We have conducted a rigorous review of all of our assets, with a particular focus on non-core assets,"" said Capps. ""There were significant fourth quarter events that led to a decline in consumer and business confidence and triggered an impairment of Dominion Capital assets. The adjusted values should allow us to pursue liquidation without negatively impacting earnings or the balance sheet going forward.""

"X-Origin: BUY-RX-FileName: richard buy 1-30-02..pstI would see the primary responsibilities:1. Develop with Fallon a written process for the valuation of terminated contracts.  We will most likely only have Bjorn for a short period of time given his reluctance to go to NETCO.  While no one appears to care about the fact that we have no way to render a correct value for financial statement purposes, this would be a priority if I was managing the estate.   There is no metric for the approval of comprises internally.  Our curves say one value, the counterparties quotes say another.  Differences in value may be a better metric that notional settlement amounts.2. With IT, assure that the terminated contracts are frozen in value.   The book is currently floating, rendering an open position which is unmeasured as to VaR.  Examine ways, if any, to manage this uncovered market risk. 3. Valuation of assets held for sale and DASH process.   It would appear that we should work backwards from the summary of sale that the Unsecured Creditors Committee wants.   There have already been complaints about multiple forms (DASH, transaction review committee for).  This would require revamping the DASH process and TAP.   4. Revaluation of International assets.5. To the extent EES performs post petition, value this book and the associated  ongoing costs associated with it.6. My understanding is that the billing on performing accounts is behind. Manage and develop a process to collect these past due amounts.  Collectibility does not improve with time.7. Ongoing review of business unit's cash requests.8. Develop a systematized IT solution to payments and transfers made 90 days prior to bankruptcy (in process).9. Manage the bankrupt counterparty portfolio.10.

The storage contract has interruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Agreement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the event the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it across the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transport fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail which stated ""he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald.""  Questions:1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter?2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?Let me know.cmm",chris.meyer@enron.com,stuart.zisman@enron.com,"X-From: Meyer, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=CMEYER>","X-To: Zisman, Stuart </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Szisman>",Bridgeline Working Gas,"X-cc: Parks, Joe </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jparks>, Nemec, Gerald </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gnemec>",2002-01-18 13:39:36-08:00
"X-Origin: PARKS-JX-FileName: joe parks 6-26-02.pstJoe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).

"X-Origin: GERMANY-CX-FileName: chris germany 6-25-02.pstI need your help to make sure that the P&L/cash estimates get updated to record the February and March capacity release revenue that ENA will be receiving from Transwestern under K#24942 (i.e. Ignacio to Blanco I/B Link).  It is my understanding that Kim will be flashing the expense at our contract rate of $0.06/Dth, therefore the demand expense that should be flashed is $42,000 for February and $46,500 for March.  TW released the capacity at the maximum rate of $0.102/Dth for February and March.  TW will keep $0.021/Dth or 50% of the amount above ENA's discounted rate (i.e. $14,700 for February and $16,275 for March).  To offset ENA's demand expenses of $0.06/Dth, the invoice will also show a credit of $0.081/Dth or $56,700 for February and $62,775 for March.  TW will be paying the difference to ENA (i.e. $14,700 on March 15th and $16,275 on April 15th).  Chris -- Please put new Sitara tickets in the system to record ENA's capacity release credit for February and MarchMaria --  It looks like TW K# 24924 can be released, either moon-to-month or permanently, above our discounted rate.

Although we did discuss the higher level issue of a new, comprenhensive, wind park based, completly revised, SCADA system -- our primary goal was finding ways to achieve ""Customer Satisfication"", with our current VisuPro SCADA system. The Tehachapi SCADA group brought with them a list of necessary fixes and required upgrades (40 individual issues) to the meeting. It is these issues we concentrated on. This list of 40 items was based on feedback from our customers, such as AEP, FPL, Zilka,  & NWP along with feedback from our O&M crew in the field, and what our own SCADA team has noticed during installation and operations. The attachment document is a compliation of that former list, where many items were already fixed, some were not necessary our could not be completed in a timely fashion and some were all part of a common group. Our new list has a total of 28 items, 5 of the highest priority, 7 of the second priority and 16 of the lowest priority. The responsible/lead group for each individual issues is also shown. The attached document is quite long but I suggest that everyone find the time to review. Our proposals include changes in the VisuPro Code, changes in the VisuPro data base structure, changes in the VisuPro storage capabilities and an additional Server PC that will provide over one full year of data storage and custom report generation to help achieve what everyone is asking for in SCADA. The details are shown in the attached document. The Tehachapi SCADA group has a video conference scheduled for Thursday to discuss the final elements of this plan -- labor resource allocation and time requirements to complete these proposed changes.  In light of our goal of having the major items running in our customers wind farms by July 15, we have prioritized each item. I will outline the final plan, including milestones and completion dates before April 9.

They have fallenfor three straight weeks amid reports from Verizon (VZ) and others thatsubscriber growth is much slower than expected due to the strugglingeconomy.The downward spiral continued after a few analysts recently downgradedthe entire sector. Without any positive developments to cling to, investorpessimism appears to be feeding on itself.

Looking ahead: Analysts predict solid 2002 for cable TV stocksConsolidation and EBITDA growth will be the year's major themesby John Filar Atwood, equity research columnistInvestors relying on cable television stocks as a defensiveinvestment were disappointed in 2001, as the group fell by about20 percent, compared with the a drop of ""just"" 13 percent for theS&P 500. But investors who now abandon the industry may findthemselves even more disappointed in 2002.Analysts are projecting a strong year for cable companies,predicting revenue growth of 13 percent and EBITDA growth of 14percent. They also believe most of the stocks are more fairlyvalued heading into 2002 than they were at the outset of lastyear, when a late-2000 runup left them overpriced.Adding to analysts' enthusiasm is the recent completion ofComcast's (CMCSK) purchase of AT&T's (T) broadband unit.

International wires: Counter-consensusThese four telecom services companies bear analysts' lowest ratings, but is that really bad news?By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnistLast week, we looked at underrated international telco equipmentcompanies. Today, we're featuring four international telecomservices companies traded in the U.S. that tote an averageanalyst rating of 4 (""underperform"") or worse.Why would an investor want to consider a poorly rated stock?Let's put it this way: A highly rated stock means a lot of peoplealready like it. If you like it too, you're going with the flow,following the pack. Me-too investing may do all right, but it'sbetter to get there first, to blaze the trail. True value isadded only if the investment opinion is different, counter-consensus, and of course, on the money.

INVESTING STRATEGIESWhy $30 and not $130?Buying stocks without knowing why prices are what they are isdangerous to your financial health.By Marc Gerstein, director of investment researchHere's the moral of the story. You should always, always, always, alwaysbe able, in your mind, to construct some sort of logical connectionbetween today's stock price and a stream of future dividends. The logicalchain might be long: you might assume years of startup losses will befollowed by more years of all profits being reinvested. But you should beable to envision some connection between today's stock prices and astream of dividends that will commence someday in the future. You don'tactually have to do the math. But you should feel comfortable that thenumbers are such that if you wanted to take the time to do it as aninteresting exercise, you could come up with some plausible set ofassumptions that make the present-day price seem somewhere in theballpark.Click here to read more.http://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=6153&nd=01232.

Is it that time again?Steve Lord: Buffett has recently come out and said he expects a five toeight year dry spell following the party we've all just been through. Soyou can figure we've got at best a three year dry spell left. Buffett alsosaid that the length of the hangover is directly proportional to the lengthof the party. And personally, I remember from my college days that thelength of the hangover can exceed the length of the party!

By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year. As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit. Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a ""grand-slam great deal"" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a ""perishable commodity."" Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month. Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book. Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility. Mr. McMahon said he feels that ""by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever"" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors. The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as ""the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life."" Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. ""You'll see the churn going away,"" says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has ""significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it."" Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses. UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be ""a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities."" The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed ""neck and neck"" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit. The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections.

By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five.

Emshwiller and Rebecca SmithStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal02/01/2002The Wall Street JournalA1(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =meeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=ately disastrous course.=20On that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=urn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=gal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a= management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=rantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.While Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=s was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=as supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=ned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=he meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=tow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=ld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =limited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =but off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=nough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20However, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,= there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=as. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=sively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=lders and creditors.=20Four years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=ng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About= two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=cause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able= to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that= Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=rs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=t bankruptcy-law protection.=20Federal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=rn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=d themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=s existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never= heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=nda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about= a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=mer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=ut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, ""We are=n't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation."" An atto=rney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=ly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20The meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =people at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=rt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =One -- Herbert ""Pug"" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=eenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =creation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,= says the executive committee was told that ""Chewco was a special-purpose v=ehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=as involved with Chewco."" The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =in attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=ow whether he was introduced or took part.=20During the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow ""=reviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=orporate structure."" Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=ng was ""positive income impact to Enron,"" according to a handout appended t=o the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=ture.=20Chewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =longtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =his firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =separate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=ng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =Barclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the= transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=h the discussions.=20A Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =is scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by= his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=o four years ago.=20Chewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had= at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as= had many competitors. Traditional ""off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=nique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=ted States,"" says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial= firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =developing, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=oney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20This financing is ""nonrecourse,"" meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=e hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=h it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =little of it publicly evident.=20To do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=lowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=tnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=he assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since= 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=st 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=soring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for= many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=rship.=20Enron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=uilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.= consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital= and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=enants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=nd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20They figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=th debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =its financing costs higher.=20Mr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =and deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=ther ""hard"" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome= and confining to achieve this. Enron would have to negotiate for months wi=th partners, banks and other outsiders before getting a deal going. ""Enron =didn't like being told no,"" says one former senior Enron executive. So Mr. =Skilling and Mr. Fastow ""found a way to avoid the discussion altogether.""==20The solution: bring the partnerships in house, without appearing to do so, =say people involved in setting up the structures.=20In 1995, according to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Fastow began app=roaching investment banks with a novel proposal. He wanted them to help him= recruit investors for partnerships that would do business with Enron. But =the partnerships would be partly owned and run by Enron executives. Donalds=on, Lufkin & Jenrette, for one, turned him down, figuring the potential con=flicts of interest were too great.=20Mr. Fastow and other Enron officials continued their discussions with vario=us banks to no avail. All the while, pressure was building. By 1997, compan=y executives would later acknowledge, debt levels were getting worrisomely =high. The company was also having a tough time meeting its earnings project=ions.=20That's when Chewco was presented to the board in the November 1997 meeting.= Having met resistance from investment banks, Enron officials turned to com=mercial banks to lend money to Chewco as well as to two small entities, als=o connected to Mr. Kopper. These two put the crucial 3% of outside equity i=nto Chewco that allowed it to be treated as separate from Enron.=20After Chewco was set up, Enron's profit performance began to improve and it=s expansion pace intensified. Mr. Skilling and his team ascended the ranks.= By 1998, he was Enron's chief operating officer, Mr. Fastow was chief fina=ncial officer and Mr. Causey was chief accounting officer.=20Chewco became a template. In June 1999, the board held a special meeting to= hear Messrs. Skilling and Fastow outline plans for a new partnership known= as LJM Cayman LP. It was designed to resolve ""certain challenges"" in prote=cting the value of a growing portfolio of volatile telecommunications asset=s, according to an excerpt from the meeting's minutes. The LJM name came fr=om the initials of Mr. Fastow's wife and two children.=20Four months later, the Enron executives proposed to the board an even more =ambitious partnership, dubbed LJM2 Co-Investment LP, to serve as a reposito=ry for other risky bets made by the company.=20Both LJMs were managed and partly owned by Mr. Fastow. In an SEC filing, En=ron recently estimated he made more than $30 million from his participation= in the entities. At least several million dollars of this was management f=ees -- a generous sum given that, in one presentation, Mr. Fastow said he w=orked just three hours a week on partnership matters.=20A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declines to comment on how much he made from the= partnerships or on LJM generally. In the past, representatives of the form=er CFO have pointed to Enron statements that its board and top management r=eviewed and approved both the creation and operation of the LJM partnership=s.=20Some Enron insiders say that whatever Mr. Fastow earned from the LJM partne=rships was a pittance compared with the benefits they provided the company.= As Enron's growth exploded in the late 1990s, worries mounted over debt le=vels, and the company needed help producing cash flow and earnings. Increas=ingly, Enron came to rely on the partnerships to take debt and troubled ass=ets off its books and produce transactions that could be reported as profit=s. How much Mr. Fastow made from the LJMs was of little concern to top mana=gement, says one former Enron executive, because the CFO was the one person= who could consistently pull ""their nuts out of the fire with some fancy tr=ansactions.""=20By the year 2000, the LJM partnerships were providing more than 40% of Enro=n's reported pretax income of about $1.4 billion, according to a recent SEC= filing by the company.=20All told, the LJM partnerships raised about $400 million from outside inves=tors and eventually did billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. Sub=structures of the LJM latticework proliferated with the creation of other e=ntities. In a May 1, 2000, presentation to the finance committee of Enron's= board, management described how an LJM offshoot called Project Raptor woul=d ""hedge the profit & loss volatility of Enron investments,"" according to i=nternal documents from that meeting.=20As part of the project, another entity called Talon was to be created with =seed capital of $400 million and an initial capacity to provide ""approximat=ely $200 million of P&L protection"" to Enron, according to one document. LJ=M2 would be the outside investor in Talon and ""be entitled to a 30% annuali=zed return plus fees,"" it said.=20At the finance-committee meeting, its minutes show, Mr. Causey said Anderse=n ""had spent considerable time analyzing the Talon structure and the govern=ance structure of LJM2 and was comfortable with the proposed transaction."" =The committee approved the Raptor-Talon plan.=20Mr. Causey's attorney, J.C. Nickens, says that his client believes the trea=tment of the partnerships ""was an appropriate interpretation of the account=ing rules as they existed then and as they still exist today.""=20Though the minutes said there was ""discussion"" of the Raptor arrangement, n=either those minutes nor similar recountings of other board gatherings indi=cate that directors seemed particularly concerned about what was happening =under the LJM umbrella. They might well have been. By last fall, public con=cern over the transactions had plunged Enron into crisis. Now, investigator=s are trying to make sense of hundreds of other Enron-related entities with= names like Braveheart, Rawhide and Bobcat. The big question: Which, if any=, may contain LJM-like problems?=20---=20John R. Wilke contributed to this article.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

""We have sent a second letter to the co=rporation asking for that information, and again they are failing to cooper=ate.""=20Bob Bennett, attorney for Enron in Washington, said Dorgan is mistaken.=20""I am terribly disappointed he would say that because we have been fully co=operative with them,"" Bennett said. ""There have been some documents they as=ked for that we did not have dealing with these partnerships, nor would we =be expected to have them.""=20The disputed documents, according to Bennett, involve independent partnersh=ips and records that Enron does not have.=20Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy was the largest in corporate history. The collaps=e of the company cost thousands of employees their jobs and wiped out most =of their retirement accounts, much of which were tied up in Enron stock.=20Lawmakers want to know when Lay became aware of the company's financial pro=blems, and whether executives hid Enron's true financial picture from emplo=yees and investors.=20""We know for example that bankruptcy didn't treat everyone alike, we know t=here are some who made millions while others lost their life savings,"" Dorg=an said. ""We also know that this corporation created off-the-books partners=hips in a very aggressive way, thousands of them, with strange-sounding nam=es but even stranger architecture in terms of how they were created.""=20Wyden compared the conduct of Enron executives to captains on a rapidly-sin=king ship.=20""They locked the workers down there in the boiler room,"" Wyden said.=20The House and Senate hearings set for Monday are among at least 10 congress=ional investigations under way into the collapse of the one-time energy gia=nt.=20In addition to Lay, witnesses before the House committee Monday will includ=e Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino and Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Sec=urities and Exchange Commission.=20Since Enron's troubles first garnered national attention months ago, Lay, w=ho resigned as chairman last week, has remained publicly silent as various =investigations unfolded into possible malfeasance at the company.=20Last week, Lay's wife, Linda, discussed the couple's troubles on a televisi=on morning show.=20Dorgan said the Senate committee has a tentative agreement with Enron's for=mer chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, to testify at a later date.=20The committee also has tried to arrange for testimony from Andrew Fastow, f=ormer chief financial for Enron, with no success.=20""We, in my judgment, will have to hear from Mr. Fastow, the question is how=,"" Dorgan said. ""At this point we have had no response at all from register=ed letters we've sent.""=20Skilling and Fastow, central figures in the free fall at Enron, are both sc=heduled to testify next week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee='s subcommittee on oversight and investigation.=20Dorgan said that more than 40 boxes of documents previously submitted by En=ron to the committee contain notes from meetings of the Enron board of dire=ctors.=20The Washington Post on Thursday reported that Enron's board received detail=ed briefings and signed off on the use of related partnerships, dating back= at least four years.=20Dorgan declined to provide significant details about the documents his comm=ittee received.=20""It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed, on various o=ccasions, the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals=. But I think you will hear more about that in the hearings,"" Dorgan said.==20The controversial partnerships are a key element in the investigation of En=ron's collapse because the company used the vehicles to shield its debt and= appear more profitable.=20President Bush, whose administration has come under scrutiny for its close =ties to Lay and Enron, made an indirect reference to the controversy Thursd=ay.=20Speaking of the need for a ""responsibility culture,"" he said companies must= be honest in their financial reporting.=20""Let's make sure when you account for losses and profits that you put it al=l on your books so everybody understands,"" Bush said in Atlanta.=20In addition to questions about the partnerships, Wyden said lawmakers will =have questions about Enron's foray into California energy markets, and part=icularly whether Enron manipulated markets on the West Coast.=20""The common culprit in my view has been secrecy and a lack of cooperation f=rom this company,"" Wyden said.

Dorgan, said that despite repeated requests,= Enron continued to refuse to turn over records of 3,000 partnerships. Inve=stigators say Enron used the arrangements to bolster the company's financia=l statements while hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.''They just simply have not cooperated,'' Mr. Dorgan said, adding that ''th=e shroud of secrecy that surrounds so much of what this corporation has don=e will not be allowed to stand.'' But he did not say whether the committee =was considering a subpoena.=20Mr. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the consumer affairs= subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said lawyers for Kenneth L.= Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, assured his staff on Wed=nesday that Mr. Lay would appear on Monday to testify before Congress. His =lawyers have not sought immunity for the testimony, Mr. Dorgan said.=20Mr. Dorgan also said another former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skill=ing, had agreed to testify in coming weeks. But he said the company's forme=r chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who Enron says made more than =$30 million from his dealings with the partnerships, has not responded to r=epeated registered letters asking him to testify. A spokesman for Mr. Fasto=w declined comment today.=20Late today, another Congressional committee investigating Enron's downfall,= the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said both Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fa=stow would testify next Thursday, along with Enron's chief accounting offic=er, Richard A. Causey; its chief risk officer, Richard B. Buy; and the boar=d of directors' audit committee chairman, Robert K. Jaedicke. A former Enro=n executive who was involved in the partnerships, Michael Kopper, has also =been subpoenaed to appear.=20A lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, disputed Mr. Dorgan's characterizati=on of the company's cooperation, saying the senator had been ''terribly mis=informed.''=20''We have been fully cooperative with that committee,'' Mr. Bennett said. '='There are some documents that the committee would like to get that we have= no access to and no control over, and I believe that may be what is raisin=g this issue. But he is getting bad information.''=20At the Senate hearing on Monday morning, Mr. Lay, who was ousted from his j=ob by Enron's creditors last week, is expected to testify that important de=tails of the partnerships and investments were kept from him and the board.==20Many investigators doubt his claims of ignorance, and Mr. Lay may be presse=d about why he sold millions of dollars of Enron stock last year even as he= promoted the value of the shares to Wall Street and his own employees. Min=utes of Enron board meetings also show that Mr. Lay was present when the pa=rtnerships were discussed. Mr. Lay's lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, declined comm=ent today, but in the past he has said that Mr. Lay was disposing of stock =last year to pay down loans outside the company and that the sales did not =reflect any doubts about Enron's future.=20Today, Mr. Dorgan said investigators had received 41 boxes of materials fro=m Enron, which he declined to characterize. But he did say it was clear tha=t members of the company's board had a fair degree of knowledge about the d=eals.=20Some people involved in the Congressional investigations had thought Mr. La=y was unlikely to testify before first reviewing a long-awaited report by a= special committee of Enron directors into the company's deals with the par=tnerships.=20People close to the company said the report was expected to be finished som=etime over the weekend. Before being released publicly, the report would ha=ve to be approved by the special committee and then have to be reviewed by =the full board.=20The report is likely to draw distinctions about how much various people at =Enron, including board members, Mr. Lay and other executives, knew concerni=ng the partnerships, and how much responsibility various officials bear, a =person close to the matter said. The report may also say board committees h=ad differing levels of information about the deals, this person said.=20In an interview today, Mr. Dorgan said he intended to spend a lot of time d=uring the hearing delving into details about the partnerships. But he said =it was ''pretty hard to limit inquiries in circumstances like this.''=20''I expect there will be attention to virtually all of the areas: 401(k) pl=ans, insider trading, partnership construction, a whole series of things.''==20Enron, he added, has said that some partnership information does not techni=cally belong to the company and that as a result it does not have all that =information. But, Mr. Dorgan said, ''in many cases, they own 97 percent of =the partnerships,'' so they should be able to get it.=20William C. Powers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, w=ho is chairman of the Enron special committee preparing the report, decline=d to discuss the timing of the report's release or to give details. He woul=d not even disclose whether he would be testifying before Congress next wee=k, even though he is scheduled to do so.=20Mr. Powers said the work of the committee he heads ''is not precluding any =other investigation from going forward with investigation, charges, punishm=ent, whatever.'' The report, he said, will stand on its own, and ''governme=nt agencies can build on that if they find it useful.''=20People at the law school said Mr. Powers was outraged at a suggestion publi=shed today in The Washington Post that he would be taking part in a concert=ed defense of Enron in his testimony before Congress. Mr. Powers has conten=ded from the beginning of his investigation that his role is to produce an =impartial report.=20Mr. Powers has come under fire from advocacy groups and from the local news=paper, The Austin American-Statesman, over accusations that his impartialit=y is compromised by the close ties between the University of Texas, and Enr=on and the law firms that have represented the company, especially Vinson &= Elkins.=20The critics have said that the appearance of a conflict of interest is so g=reat that Mr. Powers should not have taken on the assignment.=20''Dean Powers is a nice guy and a great professor, but unfortunately, looki=ng at the facts, he has multiple apparent conflicts that, rightly or wrongl=y, cast a shadow on this report,'' said Cristen Feldman, a lawyer for Texan=s for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign contributions in the sta=te.=20In other Enron-related developments today, Representative George Miller, De=mocrat of California, asked that no witness in the House's various Enron he=arings be given immunity without approval from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a= Republican.=20Separately, the General Accounting Office, which is preparing to sue the Wh=ite House to obtain records of meetings of executives at Enron and other en=ergy companies with administration officials working on Vice President Dick= Cheney's energy task force last spring, said it had hired the law firm of =Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood.=20In addition, Senators Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of= the Finance Committee, and Charles E.

Th=e partnerships enlisted outside investors to buy Enron assets as a means of= helping the company artificially keep its debt level low and earnings high=.=20Mistakes in the reporting of some transactions with two partnerships, LJM-C=ayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, forced the company to restate 4 1/2 years of =earnings, including a reduction in reported profit by $586 million and add =$2.5 billion in debt to its books.=20In November, the internal committee determined that Fastow and other employ=ees had profited from investments in the partnerships. Those employees were= fired.=20The report will be the first official word from the committee since then. A=t the insistence of creditors, it will be posted on Web sites of Enron and =the U.S. bankruptcy court in New York.=20Enron officials declined comment on the report, as did representatives for =Fastow and Skilling.=20An Andersen spokesman said Enron officials simply made some bad business de=cisions and are trying to blame the auditors.=20""The notion that the leaders on the board were not aware of these issues is= absolutely implausible,"" said Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton. ""These we=re sophisticated people with sophisticated business advisers.""=20Patrick McGurn with Institutional Shareholders Services, a company that adv=ises shareholders on corporate governance issues, said Enron's board may ha=ve a valid argument if it can show it didn't know enough details to assess =the risk involved.=20""There's a question as to who had the ability to see the big picture, if th=e board was so compartmentalized that they could only know one part of it a=t a time,"" McGurn said.=20It's not unusual for boards to see only summaries of very complicated deals= and issues, McGurn said.=20""But even if all of this is true, it still means either the board wasn't di=ligent enough, it willingly went along with something that was wrong, or th=ey were just stupid,"" he said.=20It's not clear if the report will also criticize Enron's longtime law firm,= Vinson & Elkins. The firm did not help set up the LJM partnerships, but wa=s asked to look into concerns raised by Enron executive Sherron Watkins in =a now well-known October 2001 memo to Lay and the board.=20In an Oct. 15 letter to Enron general counsel James Derrick, V&E's Max Hend=rick addressed some of those concerns, including the potential for conflict=s of interest in Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO and chief partner in the =LJM partnerships, and the board's waiver of its code of ethics in meetings =on June 28, 1999, and Oct. 11, 1999, to allow him to run the partnerships.==20The letter concluded that -- based on its interviews -- no outside counsel =or auditors were needed to investigate the issues further. Hendrick did say=, however, that ""bad cosmetics"" on the LJM partnerships and its investments= in certain Enron technology and communications assets, coupled with the po=or financial performance of those assets, could lead to a ""serious risk of =adverse publicity and litigation.""=20The day after the letter was written, Enron began to unwind those investmen=ts with LJM.=20The fact that the code of ethics was waived to allow Fastow to run LJM is f=urther indication that the board should have been more vigilant, said McGur=n.=20McGurn and other observers are already questioning the impartiality of the =investigation, given that many board members who approved parts of LJM are =involved. But the presence of William McLucas, the former director of the S=ecurities and Exchange Commission's division of enforcement, on the committ=ee as general counsel will lend it more credibility, said one source.=20""Lucas is a notorious hard-ass,"" said the source, who asked not to be ident=ified.

They own 18 proper=ties in Houston, Galveston, Texas, and Aspen, Colo., according to real-esta=te records. But only two of the properties, vacation homes in the resort to=wn of Aspen, are being offered for sale.=20On NBC's ""Today,"" Mrs. Lay described the couple's plight in the wake of the= Enron bankruptcy as a fight for liquidity because most of their wealth was= tied up in Enron stock, now nearly worthless. ""Other than the home we live= in, everything we own is for sale,"" she said.=20The comments stirred a torrent of criticism in Houston, where about 4,000 E=nron employees have seen their jobs and stock holdings evaporate. Belo Corp=.'s Houston television station, KHOU, reported that the couple's Houston an=d Galveston properties didn't show any sign of being for sale.=20The family's Houston-based investment office didn't return a call requestin=g clarification. According to tax and real-estate records, the Lays live in= a Houston penthouse valued at $7.1 million and continue to hold a home nea=r Aspen's riverfront valued at $4.1 million, as well as property valued at =$2.1 million. Two other homes, valued at more than $6.1 million each, were =listed with an Aspen real-estate firm on Nov. 12, two weeks before Enron fi=led for bankruptcy. Mr. Lay also sold a third of his stock in Compaq Comput=er Corp. at the end of October, two months before resigning from its board.==20However, Mr. Lay has retained significant stock holdings in Compaq, Eli Lil=ly & Co. and other companies where he once served as a director. Those shar=es are currently valued at more than $10 million.=20Still, along with Enron, the Lays have seen some investments sour. Through =private partnerships, they are the largest individual investors in a strugg=ling Houston online company that has cut its work force four times in the p=ast year.=20The Lays invested between $18 million and $20 million out of the more than =$150 million that Questia raised since its inception in 1998, according to =people close to the firm.=20Questia sells access to online books to college students for $20 a month. I=nvestors say it has fallen far short of its original goal of recruiting 10%= of the 14 million U.S. college students to sign up for its service.=20Last month, Questia cut its work force to just 28 employees from 300 a year= ago.

Morgan in the Hot Seat Banking: Charges of collusion with Enron= and its recent hefty losses raise questions about firm's judgment.E. SCOTT RECKARDTIMES STAFF WRITER02/01/2002Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-1Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror CompanyIn the rubble of recent financial collapses, one prestigious institution se=ems especially vulnerable: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's second-lar=gest bank.=20The New York company, a lead lender to Enron Corp., Kmart Corp. and telecom=munications firm Global Crossing Ltd., is at risk of losing billions in dea=lings with bankrupt firms, as well as losing heavily in Argentina's economi=c meltdown.J.P. Morgan also lost $1.1 billion last year on its stakes in businesses, i=ncluding many ailing technology companies, and is accused by insurers of he=lping Enron conceal vast losses. Morgan strongly disputes the charge, but t=he allegation, coupled with the hefty losses, raises questions about the ju=dgment of an institution that traces its roots back more than 200 years.=20The bank's woes, accompanied by sizable losses on loans at many other finan=cial giants, also reveal chinks in a banking industry generally regarded as= a pillar for the nation's recovery from an economic slowdown and from Sept=. 11.=20J.P. Morgan fares badly in comparison with big competitors such as Citigrou=p Inc., the largest U.S. banking concern, and Bank of America Inc., the thi=rd-largest. Despite their huge losses in Argentina, Enron and other corpora=te collapses, Citigroup earned $4 billion and BofA posted a profit of $2 bi=llion in the fourth quarter, bolstered in part by robust consumer lending.==20Morgan, by contrast, lost $332million in the fourth quarter, compared with =a $708-million profit a year earlier. For the year, the company still earne=d $1.6 billion.=20Wall Street's skittishness over projected losses at J.P. Morgan has been ap=parent in the steady stock sell-off in recent weeks after a ""continuing par=ade of train wrecks,"" in the words of analyst E. Reilly Tierney at Fox-Pitt= Kelton in New York.=20The stock, which traded above $40 early in December, hovered near $32 this =week before closing Thursday at $34.05, up 99 cents a share, on the New Yor=k Stock Exchange.=20Some analysts remain bullish on Morgan, saying the institution is fundament=ally sound and the financial setbacks are only temporary. And by some indus=try measures, J.P. Morgan's financials look sturdy. A key ratio of nonperfo=rming assets to total assets, for example, was just 0.87% as of Dec. 31, we=ll below the 2% figure regarded as a sign of potential trouble.=20Investors' concerns surfaced in December after Enron's bankruptcy, when J.P=. Morgan, which had a reputation for usually disclosing bad news promptly a=nd completely, suddenly tripled its estimate of its potential Enron losses,= to $2.6 billion.=20Nearly $1 billion of the total stemmed from insurers' refusals to pay Enron=-related claims on unfulfilled energy contracts. The insurers contended in =a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York that the losses resulted from =J.P. Morgan's setting up ""sham"" offshore energy trading concerns to do busi=ness with Enron.=20J.P. Morgan contends its energy trading companies were above board, adding =that--unlike Enron--it included the results on its balance sheets.=20The bank also says the hefty loan losses from the mammoth bankruptcies are =a result of J.P. Morgan's position as the leading arranger of the biggest c=redit lines to the biggest businesses. These so-called syndicated loans are= carved up and shared by dozens of banks.=20""We're handling 40% of the syndicated loans, and when companies go down we =tend to be exposed,"" said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau.=20But other banks in the syndicates typically take on responsibility for more= than 90% of the amounts lent. Though J.P. Morgan arranged $1.6 billion in =credit lines for Kmart, for example, it had just $117 million in unsecured =loans when the retailer filed for bankruptcy last month. Likewise, though J=.P. Morgan had helped arrange $2.25 billion in loans for Global Crossing, i=t's now owed less than $100 million by the telecom firm, according to peopl=e close to the situation. And while J.P. Morgan still has a $500-million ex=posure to Argentina, Citigroup and FleetBoston have far more.=20Indeed, only about 10% of J.P. Morgan's earnings come from lending these da=ys, compared with 50% a decade ago, Lemkau said, meaning its comparative cr=edit risk exposure actually has declined dramatically.=20Still, there's no denying the bank's missteps, which include an 8% stake in= an Argentine bank accused of fraud, and loans to a European cable TV compa=ny that has threatened to default on $17.5 billion in debt.=20Prospects looked far brighter at the end of 2000, when J.P. Morgan Chase & =Co. emerged in its current manifestation via the colossal merger of Chase M=anhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co.=20After deregulation tore down walls separating banks, brokerages and insurer=s, the idea was to compete better with Citigroup--itself formed in the merg=er of Citicorp and Travelers Group--by selling more services to clients. Th=e newly formed giant hoped especially to persuade companies with bank loans= to use J.P. Morgan's investment banking services, which typically are more= profitable than commercial lending.=20But the technology meltdown, the recession and Sept. 11 combined to create =the worst environment in years for stock offerings, mergers and other stapl=es of investment banking.=20The big question now, Tierney said, is whether J.P. Morgan failed to assess= credit risks properly at companies because it figured making loans was a s=ure path to bigger profit on other services.=20However, Lemkau said the dollar amount of corporate loans on J.P. Morgan's =books has declined for the last three years. ""It's a misconception we're le=nding like a drunken sailor so we can get our hand on more profitable busin=esses,"" she said. ""It's just not true.""=20No doubt reflecting the uncertainties facing all financial institutions aft=er Sept. 11 and the Enron meltdown, the range of expert opinions about Morg=an is astonishingly wide.=20Some analysts, such as Michael Mayo at Prudential Financial, have slapped ""=sell"" ratings on the bank while others, such as Diana P. Yates at A.G. Edwa=rds & Sons Inc., rate it a ""strong buy.""=20Yates characterized concerns over the insurers' allegations of collusion wi=th Enron as ""overdone."" She also warned against judging J.P. Morgan by its =admittedly atrocious last quarter.=20""They're taking some hits, but they're a big company with a $41-billion equ=ity base. It's not like they're going out of business,"" she said.GRAPHIC: Wall St.'s Verdict; ; CREDIT: Los Angeles Times=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

At the same time, the Wall Street giant pitched =Enron bonds to clients as a solid investment.=20Now, at least one institutional investor who bought the bonds is hopping ma=d -- and has taken the beef to court.In a suit filed recently in federal court in New York, Silvercreek Manageme=nt Inc., a Toronto investment company that bought Enron bonds in October, a=ccuses Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, as well as Goldman Sachs Grou=p Inc. and Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America Securities LLC, of promo=ting Enron securities even when they knew the company was on the brink of c=ollapse.=20""The brokers were calling our clients telling them that this was a wonderfu=l opportunity to buy these instruments,"" says Joe Cotchett, a lawyer repres=enting Silvercreek. ""They were giving our client a sell job.""=20Citigroup, Goldman and Banc of America declined to comment.=20The suit is one of the first to put the blame for Enron squarely on Wall St=reet's role in facilitating Enron's deception. ""Enron's investment bankers =sold the securities which propped up the pyramid,"" the suit alleges. ""In th=e process, these firms earned $214 million in underwriting fees alone, and =much more for lending, derivatives trading and merger advice.""=20But the case highlights a broader question. Did Enron's lenders have a duty= to their investing clients to disclose the depths of Enron's woes? Some an=alysts say that investors should probably have known that they were buying =securities from financial institutions who were in a position to know that =Enron was facing dire straits. Yet Citigroup wouldn't have to disclose its =knowledge of Enron's troubles because of lender confidentiality.=20""When you're a bank lender, you can hide behind the confidentiality rule,"" =says David Hendler, an analyst at market research firm CreditSights.=20In its suit, Silvercreek says the three financial firms were pitching Enron= securities to Silvercreek as late as October, including some new bonds tha=t would convert into Enron stock. The Canadian firm, which invested $175 mi=llion in Enron bonds in October, says it lost $120 million and is seeking c=ompensation and unspecified damages.=20Sure, Enron had been through a rough patch over the summer, the Wall Street= sales pitch went, according to Silvercreek's lawyers. But Enron wasn't all= that bad off, and the bonds were selling at a sharp discount. That purport=ed pitch was mirrored by some of the research reports the brokerage firms h=ad released during October.=20""We reiterate our Buy rating on Enron,"" an Oct. 19 Salomon Smith Barney rep=ort on Enron said, ""after untangling part of a complicated story involving =their balance sheet.""=20Enron's story, of course, wasn't nearly so upbeat. Its balance-sheet high j=inks caused a sudden loss of confidence, bringing about a liquidity shortag=e so dire that Enron was forced to draw down an emergency $3 billion credit= line on Oct. 25, only a few days after Salomon's report. That move signale=d Enron was running short of crucial operating capital.=20Citigroup's lending division knew as well as anybody that Enron was facing =trouble, since it had been one of the top banks arranging the credit line. =Yet the brokerage companies had Enron securities in their firm's inventory =to unload, according to the Silvercreek suit.=20Enron had sold Wall Street firms about $1.9 billion in convertible bonds th=at firms such as Citigroup were free to sell to investors by June of 2001, =the court papers say. But the sales of these securities weren't going so we=ll, Silvercreek alleges.=20So Citigroup's brokers became increasingly aggressive in pushing the Enron =bonds on institutional investors, Silvercreek's lawyers say. Citigroup sold= Silvercreek its last chunk of Enron securities on Oct. 25 -- the same day =that Enron drew down its credit line from Citigroup.=20Executives familiar with Citigroup thinking assert that Silvercreek should =have known the risks of investing in Enron as well as any other investor. M=eanwhile, the lending side knew about the problems at Enron, but the broker=age side didn't. That is in keeping with the so-called Chinese Wall on Wall= Street, which seeks to separate businesses to reduce conflicts.=20Further complicating the role of Citigroup in the dispute is that on Oct. 2=5 -- the same day Enron drew down its credit line -- Citigroup met with oth=er bankers to begin discussions on a new, $1 billion Enron credit line.=20The new financing, which was announced much later, was firmly secured by co=llateral in the form of Enron pipeline assets. Yet Citigroup effectively ro=lled some of its existing unsecured Enron financing into the new secured cr=edit line -- thereby shielding itself from Enron losses shortly after pushi=ng Enron debt on to other investors.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As the Houston ene=rgy-trading company spiraled toward its Dec. 2 bankruptcy, workers' retirem=ent savings that were bottled up in frozen 401(k) accounts evaporated with =the shrinking stock price. Some senior executives, whose holdings weren't u=nder the same restrictions, sold off millions of dollars in stock and cashe=d in deferred compensation accounts.=20The White House study, conducted by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Labor =Secretary Elaine Chao, and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, was designed to= provide greater protection for workers in the future and to give the presi=dent some political cover in the scandal that involves one of his largest f=inancial backers.=20The proposal, which would require legislation or regulatory action before t=aking effect, doesn't go as far as some bills supported by consumer and lab=or organizations. But some provisions are likely to meet resistance from bu=sinesses.=20To give employees greater flexibility to diversify their portfolios, employ=ers would be required to allow workers to sell employer-company stock after= they have participated in their 401(k) plans for three years. Many employe=rs currently require workers to hold on to company shares, especially those= that are given by the employer as a ""match"" to employee contributions, for= many years, or even until retirement. Employers enjoy tax benefits for iss=uing company stock to retirement accounts, and the practice is also cheaper= than making cash retirement contributions. But, in the case of a bankruptc=y such as Enron's, the restrictions can wipe out employee nest eggs, advoca=tes of change argue.=20The president's package wouldn't limit the amount of employer-company stock= that could be held in 401(k) plans. Such caps have been proposed in legisl=ation, including a bill introduced by Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of Cal=ifornia and Jon Corzine of New Jersey that is supported by consumer and lab=or groups.=20Calling for increased access to investment advice, Mr. Bush embraced a bill= sponsored by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio) and passed by the House last yea=r. The White House now will push for action in the Senate.=20The Boehner bill would encourage employers to provide more investment advic=e to their workers by shielding them from lawsuits and fiduciary responsibi=lity for investment decisions made based on advice given by other parties. =But the bill also would allow pension-plan managers to provide such advice,= a move which consumer groups say would result in a dangerous conflict of i=nterest.=20The National Association of Manufacturers, which is leading a coalition to =oppose major pension changes, and other industry groups have voiced support= for Mr. Boehner's bill.=20Mr. Bush's proposals also would raise the stakes for employers when they im=pose ""blackout periods"" on stock trading for pension plans. Companies routi=nely impose such periods when they are changing plan administrators, for in=stance.=20In addition to requiring senior executives to face the same blackout period=s as lower-level workers, Mr. Bush is calling for a 30-day notice before a =blackout begins. He also will recommend that employers be held responsible =for what happens to workers' investments during the periods when their stoc=k is frozen. Under current regulations, employers are protected from that l=iability.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Who Were the Friends of Enron?: Michael Lewis2002-01-31 16:25 (New York)    Berkeley, California, Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The only people who are go=ing to explain what happened at Enron Corp., and why, are the people who wo=rked there. So I'm delighted to report the trickle of notes and letters fro=m Old Enronians has become a torrent. My inbox runneth over.     This week's pile of cards and letters offers several different kinds o=f information. The first is the sort of colorful detail that will be useful= to whoever eventually makes the crummy TV movie about the energy trader's =collapse.     It's fun to know, for instance, that Enron's chief risk officer had a =picture of the Titanic on the wall of his office, and that Enron's chief ac=countant drove a Ferrari. It's even more fun to know there was plenty of se=xual scandal in the halls at Enron, to go along with the financial one. Off=ice affairs are common at any big company, but Enron's steamy Texas culture= seems to have created a particularly juicy hothouse.Book Fodder     The next category of information is the deeper understanding that will= be useful to whoever writes the respectable best-selling book about Enron.     For the first time since the scandal broke, for example, I've read a s=atisfying explanation for Enron's many disastrous investments in foreign as=sets.     As this correspondent put it, the main motive for paying ridiculously =big sums for Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on was not =foreign market information, or access to foreign politicians, but the need =to be able to cover a short position.     In its attempt to create the same sort of trading markets in developin=g countries as it had in the U.S., Enron exposed itself to a new kind of ma=rket risk.     It was one thing to be caught short in U.S. natural gas, in which you =could hedge your position on a well-established futures exchange. It was an=other to be caught short Indian electricity. Owning the underlying physical= assets ensured that would never happen. (But also ensured Enron would be c=onstitutionally long all new markets.)Friends and FOEs     The final category of information is the sort of corporate intrigue th=at will be gold to the investigative reporters newly assigned to the Enron =beat.     For example, there was, according to one former Enron employee, a grou=p of individual investors known as the Friends of Enron.     These people, ironically known as FOEs, were offered the following dea=l: Agree to put your name on a million dollar investment in a private offsh=ore partnership stuffed to the gills with junky assets, and Enron would len=d 95 percent of the money and guarantee you at least a 15 percent annual re=turn. In other words, put up fifty grand and Enron would ensure you receive=d 150 grand at the end of the year.     So, who was offered this deal? My Enron correspondent contends the lis=t of people on it will read ""like a Who's Who.''     Bloomberg News this week revealed that some individuals who put money =into Enron partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow= were executives at Merrill Lynch & Co.     This is interesting -- and not merely because of the blatant conflict =of interest in employees of a firm taking huge sums of money from Enron whe=n it is the role of their firm, in part, to serve as a detached observer of= Enron. The conceit that Wall Street firms evaluate U.S. companies honestly= was dropped long ago. (Merrill is a passive minority investor in Bloomberg= LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, and has said the investments didn't repr=esent a conflict of interest.)Looking the Other Way     No, what's astonishing is that the people who were offered these deals= by Enron didn't acknowledge what they said about a company that last year =ranked as the seventh largest in the U.S. by sales. A lot of well placed pe=ople knew such a giant company was rotten and yet no one said anything abou=t it, or altered his behavior in any way towards the company.    Or almost no one. A couple of local Houston institutional investors who= declined similar sweet deals could see clearly enough what it meant.     Danny Bowers, the chief investment officer of the Houston Fireman's Re=lief and Retirement Fund, has said ""there was a pretty blatant conflict of =interest. It was kind of a stinky deal.''     David Long, who runs the Houston Municipal Employees Pension Fund, tol=d Bloomberg News that, ""We had a lot of discussion about potential conflict=s of interest. You had the CFO of Enron, who's an employee of Enron, acting= as general partner of a partnership which for the most part could be const=rued to be adversarial to Enron.''Need Not to Know     So why didn't any respectable person respond the same way to Enron's o=ffer of free money?     One of the curious aspects of the Enron scandal is the way the world c=onfigured itself so that it didn't need to know the truth about the company=. There was a need, both financial and psychological, not to know.     Now we know the partnership structure was an open secret on Wall Stree=t. There was a lot of money to be made on the short side by a Wall Street p=erson if he leaked Enron's moral infrastructure to, say, the Wall Street Jo=urnal. But, at least as far as we know, no one at Merrill did this.     So, who else was offered a sweet deal by Enron and yet failed to be sh=ocked or alarmed? Anyone currently residing in Washington?

""This i=s not the first company to declare bankruptcy,"" she says. ""Personally, I ha=ve very high regard for Ken Lay.""=20Lovett is the head of economic development for the Greater Houston Partners=hip, a local business group with 135 CEO members, which Lay was the chairma=n of in 1994. Her job is wooing big companies to come set up shop in the la=issez-faire, pro-business Promised Land of Houston.=20She lowers her voice to remind me reverently that in this country we assume= the accused are ""innocent until proven otherwise,"" and when it comes to En=ron ""a lot of things are being tried by speculation."" But the civics lesson= is interrupted when Lovett's colleague David McCollum comes bursting in to= announce that the FBI has just occupied Enron's headquarters, based on rep=orts that employees were still shredding documents there a few days earlier=.=20""We're just having so much fun now!"" McCollum jokes before popping back out=, leaving Lovett to continue to argue that in spite of the Enron collapse t=hings here in Houston are just fine, thanks.=20Congress is holding hearings, criminal investigations are under way and cla=ss action suits are bubbling over, but in Houston, civic leaders don't want= to jump to any untoward conclusions. Despite all the sob stories generated= by thousands of local laid-off Enron workers and retirees, Mayor Lee Brown= has been careful not to cast blame. When Ken Lay resigned as the CEO of En=ron, the mayor said in a statement: ""Only those who are working all day, ev=ery day on this situation are in a position to know all the details."" Oh, a=nd by the way, Lay sponsored a $50,000 fundraiser for Brown's election last= year.=20The Houston City Council isn't exactly warming up the tar-and-feathers eith=er. Instead, it's busy awarding a $198,000 consulting contract to Arthur An=dersen, a company now feverishly attempting to escape its own immolation af=ter its failure to competently audit Enron's books. ""That disgusted me,"" sa=ys Amy Oberg, a former Enron employee who lost retirement savings in her 40=1K as well as her job. ""The fact that the city went and did that in the mid=dle of the federal investigation just blows my mind. For the people here wh=o were hurt by Enron, that was a slap in the face.""=20Greetings from Houston, the city that tries too hard. Houston is a city tha=t is proudly unapologetic about its status as an icon of anything-goes dere=gulation. Nowhere will you find a place more consciously devoted to living =the free-market version of the American dream. But there's an insecurity lu=rking beneath the pride, an inferiority complex bred in part by the spectac=ular flameouts and huge busts that are a natural consequence of living with= as few rules as possible. It is, as one resident notes, a place where ""peo=ple come to make money, and then they go someplace else. Nobody retires in =Houston.""=20Enron's fall from grace is but the most recent disaster to bring out the co=ntradictions inherent in the Houston way. Even as many Houstonians feel a l=ingering sense of betrayal and disappointment and no shortage of embarrassm=ent, they are still unwilling to ask themselves: Why did Enron happen here =in Houston? And can anything be done to prevent the next catastrophe?=20Probably not. Because to do anything substantive would be a betrayal of Hou=ston's founding myth -- the idea that the city is a place where a guy can c=ome to make a lot of money without being held back by a bunch of party-poop=ing naysayers and regulators. It's a myth that fits neatly into the explici=t deregulation platform so heavily promoted by Ken Lay and Enron, and it's =not something that Houstonians will give up on easily.=20""There will be no reform in Houston,"" predicts Dr. Alvin Tarlov, a physicia=n and policy advisor at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston.==20There never is.=20""This is a city where you can make your fortune and not have people looking= over your shoulder saying: 'You can't do that,'"" says Houston native Carlo=s Hernandez, with evident pride, adding quickly: ""Enron was taking that to =the extreme. That's just criminal.""=20But from the beginning, Houston's wide-open ethos has been an invitation to= criminals. ""Houston is a city that started as a land scam. It's still a wi=ldcatters town,"" says Jim Hightower, the Texas writer and wisecracker. Back= in the 1820s the city's roguish developers sold scrip for 5 or 10 cents an= acre that didn't actually convey property rights to any land. It was a sca=m that makes pushing stock that's not based on real revenues look pretty ta=me.=20To this day, locals eschew government oversight so much that many suburbani=tes here don't even live under any city government. They inhabit unincorpor=ated districts run by the residents, in a barely governed super-sprawl of c=heap housing. Here's how it works: A developer buys a piece of the endless =raw prairie land outside city limits. He puts a trailer on it and has his c=onstruction foreman move in. Then, an only-in-Texas ""election"" is held. The= sole voter -- the construction foreman -- votes in favor of developing the= property, and voila! -- a new district is created complete with tax-exempt= bond status.=20When the new 'burb is built and inhabited, the developer turns it over to t=he citizens, who repay the debt from the bonds with property taxes. There a=re some 400 of these unincorporated districts in the Greater Houston area, =and you only really hear about them when the City of Houston cherry-picks a= wealthy one, annexing it to assume its lucrative tax base -- usually again=st vehement ""Don't tread on me!"" protests from the residents.=20In the unincorporated areas and the city proper that together make up the s=prawling greater Houston area, population 4.5 million, lies a case study in= what is wrought by living according to the commandment ""There shall be no =zoning."" Sublime, helter-skelter juxtapositions are everywhere. Right next =to an eight-lane freeway, a Discount tire store huddles near a traveling ca=rnival; children spin themselves silly on blinking rides that rival NASA's =anti-gravity chambers, under the vacant gaze of an overly made-up model loo=ming down from a billboard advertising an all-night porn store. And don't m=iss the 20-story office building right across the street from a neighborhoo=d of brand-new monster houses, with no niceties like landscaping buffering =the commercial district from the residential one. Neighborhood deed restric=tions impose some conformity, but those rules end at the property lines -- =then, hallelujah! Anything goes! There were a few years there in the early ='90s when the Houston City Council did impose zoning, albeit after the fact=, but by 1994 the citizens had voted to repeal this brazen act of governmen=t intervention.=20""Strip malls and strip clubs. There's a Gap on every corner next to a Starb=ucks,"" says Tracy Delmer, a speech pathologist who has lived here all her l=ife. ""It's all about trying to make your strip mall prettier than the other= strip mall down the street.""=20The flip side to freedom from nasty government oversight is some of the wor=st air pollution in the country. Some 2.5 percent of the world's total refi=ning capacity lies in the greater Houston area, and Houston's high ozone re=adings are rivaled only by Los Angeles. The state, in true Texas laissez-fa=ire style, has been notoriously lax on environmental regulation, allowing o=ld petrochemical plants to be grandfathered in when introducing new, watere=d down environmental rules, which just means that those old, polluting plan=ts never seem to die off.=20""That's Texas. If the federal government forces Texas to do it, they do it,="" says Jim Blackburn, a Houston environmental lawyer. ""But otherwise, it's =all up for grabs.""=20Is it any wonder that few people seem to come here just for fun? ""People do=n't say 'I went to Houston last summer,'"" says Delmer, ""like they say 'I we=nt to Seattle.'""=20""All over the country, if people hear they're being transferred to Houston =they want to commit suicide,"" says Amy Jaffe, a local energy policy advisor=, who still finds the distaste outsiders have for Houston puzzling. It's no=t as if Houston is some kind of cultural wasteland, she notes, enumerating =a laundry list of Houston's sophisticated worldly charms, from the opera to= the ballet to the symphony.=20All of which, it should be noted, are funded almost entirely by private sou=rces.=20Nationally, Enron's demise is stirring debate on a huge range of issues, fr=om campaign finance reform to accounting rules to the very ascendancy of th=e idea of deregulation.=20But not here in Houston.=20""None of us blame President Bush or free-market capitalism for Enron's coll=apse,"" says Raymund Eich, a local patent agent, who believes that liberals =are using the Enron bankruptcy as an excuse to smear both. Only Dallas and =Washington gave more money to Bush's 2000 campaign than Houston, and Enron =is well known to be Bush's single biggest corporate backer, but Eich doesn'=t think the government owes anything to hard-hit Enron employees or investo=rs, noting that ""Houstonians are more self-reliant than people in other pla=ces.""=20Take Houston accountants -- a phrase that in February 2002 sounds like the =punchline to a very bad joke waiting to happen. Here's a group who would li=ke very much to remain self-reliant, even as they fear that their days of s=elf-regulation may be numbered, thanks to Andersen's bad behavior. Over lun=ch -- beef stew on noodles -- the members of the Houston Chapter of the Tex=as Society of Certified Public Accountants at their annual business meeting= at the J.K. Marriott dish about Andersen's role in the Enron debacle.=20""I think someone should pay,"" says Ann-Marie Curtin, a CPA at Prime Asset M=anagement, a Houston property company. ""There's no way that there wasn't a =significant amount of illegal activity going on.""=20But new rules to help prevent such nefarious activities? They won't hear of= it. Patrick L. Durio, president-elect of the local group and the chairman =of the -- voluntary! -- ethics committee of the Texas Society of CPAs, says=: ""Government regulation is not the answer. I don't want to see the governm=ent setting accounting standards,"" noting that the industry has been self-r=egulating for 100 years. ""And I don't think that politicians should be gett=ing involved in it.""=20In Houston, they probably won't. Because no matter how big Enron's corporat=e implosion appears on the national scale, such colossal busts are hardly u=nusual in Houston history. In fact, Enron is a mere blip compared to the ci=ty-wide bust that occurred in the mid-'80s. Houston is always trying to sha=ke the perception that it's just an urban pit stop for roughnecks who rip n=atural resources out of the ground on the way to getting really, really ric=h. Because many Houstonians remember what happened when those roughnecks an=d their moneymen ran the town right into the ground.=20""Imagine a city where everybody had gone to Las Vegas for the weekend and l=ost everything they owned,"" says Jaffe.=20In the mid-'80s, the city lost a quarter of a million jobs in the oil and r=eal estate bust. ""There were a lot of people who went from owning lots of r=eal estate in West Houston and driving a Porsche to having to take a job se=lling aluminum siding. Everybody was a kazillionaire,"" says Jaffe, ""and all= of a sudden, everybody was bankrupt over the course of, like, three years.="" Banks just couldn't keep up with all the foreclosures on the suburban hou=ses stocked with '80s amenities -- the backyard swimming pool, the built-in= wet bar and the Jacuzzi.=20The bust inspired a favorite Houston bumper-sticker, begging God for a seco=nd chance, for another oil boom: ""God, if you bring it again, we won't scre=w it up this time.""=20Things were so depressed circa 1986 that a volunteer civic organization cal=led Houston Proud formed to try to cheer up the beleaguered populace. The H=ouston Proud theme song was a relentlessly upbeat ditty that tried too hard=. Sample lyric: ""We're Houston Proud! Proud of the things we've done togeth=er!"" Commercials aired on local TV pairing the song with chipper images of =smiling Houstonians to market Houston to its own people, as if to plead, ""P=lease don't lose faith. Just don't move away.""=20And maybe that's where the inferiority complex comes from: This is a city t=hat knows what it feels like to fall flat on your face, to go from driving =a Porsche to selling aluminum siding. Or maybe a city where the free-market= conquers all knows it's inevitably a little rough around the edges.=20Congratulations, Houston! You've just been named ""The Fattest City in Ameri=ca"" by Men's Fitness magazine for the second year in a row. To respond to t=he salvo, Mayor Brown recently launched a campaign to inspire Houstonians t=o slim down, by starting with his own waistline. If you can't rule by polic=y, why not govern by example?=20The taxes are so low here that the city government needs a public referendu=m to do anything beyond barely keeping the surface streets functional. Behi=nd the scenes, it's businesspeople, both informally and through the Greater= Houston Partnership, who push civic projects and sweetheart deals along, f=rom downtown revitalization to building new stadiums. In Houston, the busin=ess agenda is the civic agenda.=20""The shadow government decided where the football stadium is going to be, h=ow much public money was going to be put into it, and where the money would= come from,"" explains Tarlov. Ken Lay led the approval process of the new b=aseball stadium, which now bears the name of his disgraced company.=20The sign that says Enron Field, which the now-bankrupt company pledged to p=ay $100 million for, is the most vivid symbol that Enron's shame is also a =big black eye for Houston. But neither Enron Field nor the Compaq Center --= Compaq cut 8,500 jobs last spring and may still be absorbed by Hewlett-Pac=kard -- has soured local politicians on the naming game. Right now, the Cit=y Council is considering selling off different rooms of the new convention =center for corporate branding.=20Houston has struggled since the catastrophic oil bust of the '80s to change= its wildcatting ways. And like an investor who learned her lesson the hard= way when her 401K turned out to be composed 80 percent of Enron stock, Hou=ston has shed its overdependence on the energy industry, with some success.= The city now boasts that while 82 percent of all economic activity in the =early '80s was energy-related, now it's about 49 percent. That still means =it's a town whose fortunes are tied to the price of oil, just less so.=20But even with big local employers Compaq and Continental on the ropes, Enro=n evaporating and the price of oil down from $30 a barrel in early 2000 to =$18 a barrel today, the city has lost only 5,700 seasonably adjusted jobs, =according to the University of Houston's Institute for Regional Forecasting=. That means while the country has shed about 1 percent of its job base in =the recession, even with Enron's fall, Houston has lost only a quarter perc=ent of its base. Houston may be down, but it is still ahead of the rest of =the country.=20But the collapse of Enron means something more here than the loss of jobs o=r money or even face. Lay was the archetypal Good Houston Businessman: a yo=ung man from somewhere else who comes to town, makes a lot of money and sho=wers it back on the community, while building his good name. He was widely =thought to be a promising candidate for mayor when Brown's term expires on =term limits next year, prompting comparisons to Houston's great-granddaddy =of civic business leaders, Jesse ""Mr. Houston"" Jones.=20And before its collapse, Enron represented Houston's best idea of itself --= an innovative, technocratic, deregulation innovator that might be a bit on= the arrogant and greedy side but was also philanthropic and civic-minded, =a company transforming itself out of the oil and gas business into a new ec=onomy conglomerate that even sold broadband services. Enron was the New Hou=ston.=20Not even the city's official civic pride cheerleaders can entirely brush of=f Enron. Lynn Nutt, chair of Houston Proud, confides: ""The self-esteem here= in Houston is very depleted.""=20But in a city that's always trying to prove itself, there's no time for nav=el-gazing about whether Enron's collapse means that there's something inher=ent in Houston's culture that breeds such colossal screwups. The Houston wa=y isn't to wallow and whine. It's to declare -- all together now! -- your p=ride in your city, while leaving the congressional investigators, the FBI a=nd the courts to sort out that Enron mess. In bike-riding, eco-friendly, gr=anola-eating Portland, Ore., they may be singing the ""Enron Blues,"" but her=e in Houston, headquarters for the largest bankruptcy in history, they're s=till Houston Proud!=20Just in time for all the Enron fuss, there's a new Houston Proud ""Rally Son=g"" by local songwriter Phil Blackman: ""Houston is the Place to Be.""

It has also =acknowledged destroying Enron-related records and admitted this week that i=t has lost clients. Some analysts have suggested that Andersen might be so =heavily damaged that it will have to seek a merger with another accounting =firm.Harry Reasoner, who was Vinson & Elkins' managing partner until the end of =last year, said the law firm is not free to comment in detail about its wor=k for Enron because of attorney-client privilege.""It is particularly frustrating because we're confident that when the full =facts come out that it will be clear that we have conducted ourselves in a =manner that is both professional and is required by our ethical obligations=,"" he said.One aspect of the firm's work for Enron already has raised eyebrows: At Enr=on's request, it investigated internal warnings last fall of possible wrong=doing involving some of the partnerships that eventually led to the company='s bankruptcy, despite a warning that Vinson & Elkins had previously provid=ed some legal advice pertaining to the partnerships.Outside legal experts agree that it's too soon to tell whether the firm act=ed legally and ethically. But that doesn't mean it has nothing to worry abo=ut, they added.""Even if Vinson & Elkins is determined to have no legal liability in this m=atter, its reputation has been tarnished,"" said Milton ""Mitt"" Regan, who te=aches a course on professional responsibility and corporate lawyers at Geor=getown University Law Center in Washington.One issue, Regan said, is just what role Vinson & Elkins played in the crea=tion of the partnerships that were used by Enron to move debt off its own b=ooks, which apparently benefited some Enron executives and helped lead to b=ankruptcy.""We will need to know whether Vinson & Elkins was confined to the narrow ta=sk of opining on the legality of business proposals that others developed, =or whether it took a more expansive role as a member of the team that devel=oped business strategies,"" Regan said in an e-mail interview.John Dzienkowski, a University of Texas law professor who also teaches prof=essional responsibility, said even if Vinson & Elkins did nothing wrong, th=e firm probably won't avoid legal action against it.""Given their deep pockets and high profile, they're likely to be targets of= plaintiffs looking for remedies,"" he said.Just last August, another prominent Texas law firm, Locke Liddell & Sapp LL=P, paid $8.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought against it by investors of= Brian Russell Stearns, who was convicted of running a phony investment sca=m. And in April 2000, the same firm agreed to pay $22 million to settle a l=awsuit brought by investors in Austin Forex International, a failed foreign= currency firm run by former UT football star Russell Erxleben.Investors claimed that Locke Liddell helped Stearns and Erxleben defraud th=em. Locke Liddell denied any wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid length=y and expensive litigation - a decision that Vinson & Elkins may face event=ually, said Dzienkowski.Still, he said, Vinson & Elkins' professional reputation is so strong that =he doubts it will suffer permanent harm.To make sure, Vinson & Elkins has hired some of the top names in the legal =profession to defend it. One is Joe Jamail, a renowned Houston trial lawyer= better known for battling firms such as Vinson & Elkins than helping them.= But Jamail already has persuaded plaintiffs' lawyers in two lawsuits again=st Enron to drop Vinson & Elkins as a defendant.Another top gun hired by Vinson & Elkins is John Villa, of the top Washingt=on firm of Williams & Connolly LLP. He specializes in defending prominent l=aw firms.Reasoner said Villa is overseeing Vinson & Elkins' cooperation with the var=ious investigations: ""I don't believe in our lawyers representing themselve=s when they're called on to testify as witnesses.""Founded in 1917, Vinson & Elkins is the second-largest law firm in Texas, a=ccording to a survey last year by a trade publication, Texas Lawyer. It has= 860 lawyers, including 110 in its Austin office, making it one of the city='s largest law firms. (Don Wood, partner in charge of the Austin office, sa=id none of the Austin lawyers were assigned to Enron.) It also has offices =in other cities, including Dallas, Washington, London, Moscow and Singapore=.Its revenues last year were about $455 million.""Enron was only 7-plus percent of our revenue,"" Reasoner said. ""That's sign=ificant, but I mean, it's not material to us economically in the sense of h=arming us. And of course people are upset by reading unpleasant publicity. =But I don't think anyone is concerned that it will affect us in the long ru=n.""Vinson & Elkins is the kind of firm people have in mind when they talk abou=t ""establishment"" or ""white shoe"" lawyers, those representing banks, major =corporations, insurers and wealthy individuals.It is well-connected, politically and otherwise. Al Gonzales, general couns=el to President Bush and a former Texas Supreme Court justice, is a former =Vinson & Elkins partner. And some of Enron's 200-plus in-house lawyers used= to work at Vinson & Elkins, including the company's general counsel, James= Derrick.(Another major Houston law firm that has done work for Enron, Bracewell & P=atterson, has severed all ties with the company. Two of its partners, Marc =Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Greg Abbott, a =candidate for Texas attorney general, have been criticized for their links =to a firm working for Enron.)Vinson & Elkins recruits some of the top law school graduates in the countr=y - first-year associates start at $110,000 - and the firm, as well as Enro=n, has contributed to the UT Law School foundation. Reasoner serves on the =foundation's board, as did Derrick until October.Those connections have attracted some criticism of the Law School dean, Wil=liam Powers, after he was elected last year to the Enron board and named ch=airman of a special committee to investigate the company's finances. Powers= has denied any conflict.The most obvious cloud on Vinson & Elkins' Enron dealings at this point app=ears to be the investigation it undertook last fall, at Enron's request, re=garding warnings from an Enron executive that the company could ""implode in= a wave of accounting scandals.""The executive, Sherron Watkins, also advised former Enron Chairman Ken Lay =not to use Vinson & Elkins for the investigation because it had provided le=gal advice in the past to some of the entities whose actions she was questi=oning.=20Most of her concerns, however, centered on the accounting of the transactio=ns between the partnerships and Enron, warning that although they had the b=lessing of Arthur Andersen, ""none of that will protect Enron if these trans=actions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day.""But Enron nevertheless selected Vinson & Elkins, which on Oct. 15 sent a se=ven-page letter to company executives that reported no apparent law-breakin=g and advised that there was no need to hire independent counsel or auditor=s.=20However, it warned that some of the transactions in question had ""bad cosme=tics,"" with ""a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation.""Reasoner said that Watkins' warnings did have an effect; Enron afterward ac=knowledged the problems and reported publicly its major financial losses.And he hints that Vinson & Elkins did more than suggested by its report: ""T=he notion that this was a whitewash or that the company didn't deal with it= - I'm not free to say what our oral advice is or why they did what they di=d, but they certainly did deal with it.""And, Reasoner said, the firm ""was not asked to examine our own legal work"" =in the investigation.Others will, however, including Congress and the Securities and Exchange Co=mmission.You may contact Bruce Hight at bhight@statesman.com or (512) 445-3977.=20=20New Prosecutor Is an `Iron Fist In a Velvet Glove'By Jerry MarkonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal02/01/2002The Wall Street JournalB1(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)When James Comey was a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va., he riled up the= area's three federal judges in a way that prosecutors rarely do. In a high=ly unusual joint opinion, the judges criticized Mr. Comey's pet project to =crack down on gun crimes by prosecuting them in federal courts, where sente=ncing was tougher, rather than state courts.=20""It's a total intrusion on the sovereign state of Virginia,"" Richard Willia=ms, one of the judges, says in an interview. At the same time, he adds: ""I =have a very high regard for Jim Comey. . . . He did an outstanding job.""Such sentiment is often heard about Mr. Comey, who is expected to be confir=med soon by the Senate as the new U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Imposing at 6=-foot-8 and reputed for his tenacity, Mr. Comey -- who's been involved in h=ighly charged cases from terrorism to an earlier Enron Corp. case -- seems =the classic tough-as-nails prosecutor. But as one Richmond defense lawyer, =Steven Benjamin, puts it, Mr. Comey is ""an iron fist in a velvet glove. He'=s extremely pleasant, but if you challenge him, you go to war. He will not =yield an inch on something that matters to him.""=20Allan Applbaum, a former New York federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Co=mey in the early 1990s, notes: ""He has this combination of strength and boy=ish charm that really does disarm people.""=20Mr. Comey, 41 years old, will need these qualities in his new job, which he= began on an interim basis last month. With its focus on Wall Street crime,= the Mafia and, in recent years, terrorism, Manhattan's federal prosecutor =is traditionally the most visible of the country's 93 U.S. attorneys.=20But since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has centralized terrorism inves=tigations in Washington, saying the events required a coordinated national =response. It's a significant change: Since the first World Trade Center att=ack in 1993, most major terrorism cases had been handled in New York. Now, =key terrorism cases are being filed in Mr. Comey's old district in Virginia=.=20A native of Yonkers, N.Y., Mr. Comey won the attention of Attorney General =John Ashcroft and President Bush with accomplishments such as his quick ind=ictment last year of 14 men in the 1996 terrorist bombing of military barra=cks in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American airmen. FBI officials had bee=n frustrated at the slow pace of the government's investigation, and reques=ted that the case be transferred to Mr. Comey, who was then in Richmond.=20As an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the early 1990s, Mr. Come=y won guilty pleas from two former executives of Enron's oil-trading subsid=iary to charges of conspiring to defraud the parent company through a serie=s of phony oil- trading contracts. He also oversaw the hunt for fugitive Ma=rc Rich, who was later pardoned by President Clinton.=20Mr. Comey recalls a 1992 trip to a mountaintop hotel in Zurich, Switzerland=, expecting to meet Mr. Rich and his lawyers to arrange the fugitive's surr=ender. But Mr. Rich's side argued instead that the racketeering and tax-eva=sion charges he faced had no merit, and Switzerland had already refused the= U.S.'s extradition request.=20""It was a bit frustrating. We felt we had wasted an enormous amount of time=,"" Mr. Comey says. ""The chocolates were lovely though.""=20Mr. Comey had more success with his gun-crime program in Virginia starting =in the mid-'90s. Facing concerns that Project Exile was anti-black because =most gun crimes involve blacks, he met with the critical federal judges and= community leaders to emphasize that the program would help victims. He eve=ntually won widespread support for the program, which helped cut the murder= rate in Richmond by half. At least 12 other cities, including Baltimore an=d Oakland, Calif., have started their own version of Project Exile.=20Mr. Comey calls his new position ""a dream job,"" and seems confident that th=e New York office's central role in prosecuting high-profile cases will be =maintained. ""There's always a healthy tension between an aggressive, indepe=ndent U.S. attorney's office and headquarters [in Washington], but I don't =see any kind of sea change,"" he says.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LublinStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal02/01/2002The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)When the board audit committee of Enron Corp. gathered for a regular meetin=g at its Houston headquarters a year ago, the session should have been anyt=hing but routine.=20After all, Enron management wanted a blessing for every transaction during =2000 between the energy-trading company and two partnerships run by then-Ch=ief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The controversial partnerships kept si=gnificant debt off the books, pumped up profits -- and earned Mr. Fastow mo=re than $30 million.Yet committee members, all of them outside directors, didn't challenge a si=ngle transaction, according to knowledgeable people and excerpts of the Feb=. 12 meeting's minutes. Their indifference wasn't a complete surprise. The =full board twice had taken the rare step of suspending the corporate-ethics= code, so Mr. Fastow could head the partnerships.=20Subsequent disclosure of losses related to the partnerships hastened Enron'=s collapse. Now, amid finger-pointing at top management and the company's o=utside auditors at Arthur Andersen LLP, the audit committee is under harsh =scrutiny from a slew of civil, criminal and congressional investigations --= and the board itself.=20A special board committee looking into the debacle is expected to partly bl=ame the six-member audit panel in a report to be issued as early as this we=ekend. The report will cite slick presentations by sophisticated financial =people along with lethargy on the part of audit-committee members, says an =individual close to the situation. The panel discovered significant defects= in procedures for monitoring financial results and controls, the individua=l adds.=20Critics who contend Enron's audit panel fell short cite several key reasons=: Several members held cozy ties with the company, they say. The panel's ch=airman -- Robert K. Jaedicke, retired accounting professor and former dean =of Stanford University's business school -- preferred a relatively passive =role. And Andersen auditors apparently weren't persuaded that they should b=e answerable to the audit committee as their client. ""It's the worst audit =committee I have ever seen,"" asserts John Nash, president emeritus of the N=ational Association of Corporate Directors.=20""This audit committee worked pretty well based on the information it was pr=ovided,"" retorts W. Neil Eggleston, counsel for Enron's outside directors a=nd a partner at Howrey Simon Arnold & White in Washington. Andersen signed =off on accounting practices and didn't alert members about ""any impropriety= or irregularity"" until November, Mr. Eggleston adds. Audit-committee membe=rs either declined to comment about their role or didn't return calls.=20An Andersen spokesman, asked to respond to Mr. Eggleston's critique, said t=he notion that ""the audit committee or senior management wasn't aware of th=e risks of the business decisions they were making is entirely implausible.="" Regarding criticism of its auditing work, Andersen says Enron withheld cr=ucial information and misled the auditors about the partnerships; Enron fir=ed Andersen last month.=20At first glance, Enron's pivotal audit panel, made up of prominent executiv=es, looks well-qualified. But in reality, governance specialists contend, t=he committee's makeup is far from ideal.=20For one thing, half its members live abroad -- an uncommon practice at audi=t panels, which meet often and require a keen grasp of business practices h=ere. As an American citizen, Hong Kong billionaire property developer Ronni=e Chan may understand U.S. business. But he has the worst recent attendance= record of any Enron director. He missed more than 25% of board and committ=ee meetings during 1996, 1997 and 2000, according to proxy statements. (In =1998 and 1999 he missed fewer meetings, though the percentage wasn't report=ed because it was less than 25%.)=20Corporate-governance experts doubt some other audit-committee members are t=ruly independent. Lord John Wakeham joined the board in 1994, four years af=ter the then-British energy secretary approved plans for Enron to build a p=ower plant in the United Kingdom. Since 1996, proxy statements show, he has= earned $72,000 a year advising its European unit -- more than his $50,000 =annual stipend for being a director. In a statement last week, Lord Wakeham='s office said it ""would clearly be wrong of him"" to make any comments abou=t his position at Enron while the matter is being investigated.=20John Mendelsohn is president of University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Ce=nter, which has received nearly $1.6 million in donations from Enron and re=lated entities since 1985, the year his predecessor Charles A. LeMaistre be=came an Enron director. Dr. Mendelsohn has said the center doesn't depend h=eavily on Enron philanthropy.=20Dr. Jaedicke, who is 73 years old, is the most important -- and, to corpora=te governance experts, perhaps most problematic -- member of Enron's audit =panel. The unpretentious retired academic commands respect for his meticulo=us thoroughness. But he has led the Enron audit panel since he obtained his= board seat in 1985. Big-business boards typically switch committee heads e=very three to five years to maintain distance from management.=20Dr. Jaedicke feels his lengthy tenure never crimped his outside perspective=, Mr. Eggleston says. But some question whether Dr. Jaedicke's long service= to Enron may have contributed to his approach.=20He took a relatively passive role, for example, when the board first waived= the ethics code in mid-1999. To form a private partnership called LJM Caym=an LP, Mr. Fastow needed a special board ruling that his activities wouldn'=t violate policies intended to protect against executives being involved in= activities that might pose a conflict of interest or harm Enron.=20The audit committee's charter, disclosed in the latest proxy statement, des=cribes its responsibility for overseeing ethics-code compliance. Yet the pa=nel took no action about suspending the code before the full board met; nor= did Dr. Jaedicke propose an audit-committee review during that board meeti=ng, Mr. Eggleston reports.=20""The audit committee should have made the code suspension part of their wor=k, especially since the partnership would involve the CFO,"" says Charles El=son, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of D=elaware's business school. And Dr. Jaedicke, as the committee's chairman, ""=should have been upset over the proposed waiver of the code.""=20To the contrary, according to excerpted minutes from Enron's board meeting =on June 28, 1999, it was Dr. Jaedicke who seconded the motion suspending th=e ethics code when directors approved a resolution that Mr. Fastow's partne=rship participation ""will not adversely affect the interests of the Company=.""=20He saw the partnership as a ""one-off, isolated transaction. It didn't look =like there was much risk at that time,"" Mr. Eggleston explains. In addition=, the lawyer continues, committee members ""believed that Arthur Andersen wa=s involved in blessing the LJM partnerships.""=20Also raising eyebrows is the audit committee's lack of involvement in decid=ing which law firm would conduct the nearly two-month probe into a letter w=arning of questionable accounting last August by Enron Vice President Sherr=on Watkins. Her letter raised alarms about the unorthodox partnerships and =their potential danger to Enron's finances and public image.=20At numerous companies, the audit-committee chairman decides which law firm =should probe a serious whistle-blowing complaint. ""That's the only way you =maintain the integrity of the company,"" says Roderick M. Hills, a former Se=curities and Exchange Commission chairman who has led more than six audit c=ommittees.=20Instead, at Enron, management made the decision to retain Houston law firm =Vinson & Elkins to explore concerns described in the letter Ms. Watkins sen=t and discussed with then-chairman Kenneth Lay. Her letter cautioned agains=t using Vinson & Elkins as investigators because it had issued legal opinio=ns endorsing some of the partnerships.=20Dr. Jaedicke didn't learn about the Watkins letter or the outside lawyers' =inquiry until it ended, when Vinson & Elkins briefed him about the finding,= Mr. Eggleston says. He maintains this didn't bother Dr. Jaedicke because h=e knew corporate policy required that in-house attorneys review employee co=mplaints from any level and decide whether to seek outside legal help. Crit=ics say that the Vinson & Elkins Oct. 15 report in effect ignored the accou=nting problems, by concluding that Enron's practice of forming special-purp=ose entities to keep debt off its books was ""creative and aggressive"" but w=asn't ""inappropriate from a technical standpoint.""=20Enron's auditors also knew about the Watkins allegations long before the au=dit committee did. An Aug. 21 Andersen memo summarizes a conversation in wh=ich the whistle-blowing executive, a former Andersen auditor, shared her co=ncerns about Enron's questionable accounting with an Andersen audit partner= not assigned there. The partner passed along what he termed ""a very troubl=esome scenario"" to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm's law=yers. Andersen says it also informed Enron management.=20By Oct. 9, Andersen analysts had determined there was ""a red alert: a heigh=tened risk of financial-statement fraud"" at Enron, according to an Andersen= e-mail. The Andersen spokesman says the financial-statement test described= in the e-mail was conducted on an ""experimental basis"" using software late=r found to be flawed and doesn't know what actions auditors took to address= the ""red alert.""=20Again, however, Enron's audit committee didn't immediately learn of this. N=ot until Nov. 2, when the company's financial condition had seriously deter=iorated, did Andersen tell the Enron board of ""possible illegal acts within= the company"" concerning one partnership, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph B=erardino told lawmakers. Six days later, the complex partnerships caused En=ron to restate nearly $600 million in earnings reported over five years.=20Some suspect Andersen auditors failed to keep Enron's audit committee well-=informed because they saw their main responsibility as serving the company'=s management, and not the full board or the audit committee. ""It's usually =the comptroller that recommends to the audit committee who the auditors sho=uld be,"" a former Enron official observes. Andersen auditors worked ""with t=he company day by day. They saw the audit committee once a quarter.""=20Yet at some companies audit-panel chairmen aggressively try to reverse that= misconception, thereby protecting auditors against management mischief. ""Y=ou're there to make sure [auditors] report to you"" and that only directors =can fire them, Mr. Hills says. So, he occasionally spends all day at audito=rs' offices making sure they consider conservative accounting methods.

All Rights Reserved. =09UT dean too close to Enron inquiryEditorial BoardAustin American-StatesmanThursday, January 31, 2002University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers Jr. has been described a=s a man with an unswerving moral compass.=20There is no reason to believe otherwise. But frankly, the dean's moral comp=ass is not the issue in the debate over whether he should lead Enron's inte=rnal investigation of what went wrong with the Houston-based energy trader.==20Public trust is the issue.=20Powers is a member of the Enron board. His law school has close ties to Enr=on and its money. The dean is probing partnerships that hid the company's l=osses. As lead investigator, Powers will issue a report on the nature of th=ose transactions.=20The goal of the investigation -- to get to the bottom of Enron's financial =scandal -- clearly is compromised with Powers at the helm. Powers should st=ep down from that role to ensure that there can be no questioning or doubt =about the objectivity of the inquiry. Enron, a publicly traded company, owe=s its shareholders an investigation. Investors, out-of-work employees and o=thers are entitled to a comprehensive probe that steers clear of conflicts =-- even perceived ones.=20That is why the Enron board should hire a third party with no ties to the c=ompany for the job.=20The larger principle at stake in the board's investigation is public confid=ence. U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft as well as Texas Attorney General= John Cornyn set an example by recusing themselves from investigating Enron=, which contributed heavily to both. Ashcroft lost his U.S. Senate seat las=t year in his native Missouri. Ashcroft and Cornyn wisely understood that t=he issue was not whether they could conduct fair investigations, but whethe=r the public would trust their investigations given their financial ties to= Enron and its former CEO, Ken Lay.=20That is the issue at the heart of the debate over Powers. Unfortunately, th=e Enron board doesn't seem to get it. It downplays ties between Enron and U=T, including the close connection between Powers and top Enron executive Ja=mes Derrick Jr.=20Derrick is a major fund-raiser for the UT law school and, until recently, w=as a member of its Law School Foundation that supplements Powers' UT salary=. He resigned after Powers joined the Enron board.=20After Enron made the last installment of its $250,000 pledge to the UT law =school last year, Powers sent Derrick a handwritten note, ""Thank you for al=l you do for us!""=20The Enron-UT-Powers connections go deeper. Houston-based Vinson & Elkins, w=ith offices in Austin, is a generous donor to the law school. Enron is one =of the firm's major clients.=20We wanted to discuss these issues with Powers. But we were referred to Kare=n Denne, an Enron public relations representative in Houston.=20Denne said the board doesn't see anything wrong with Powers heading the inv=estigation. It appointed him to the board last fall for that very purpose, =she said. The company had begun its financial free fall when Powers joined =the board in October.=20""The board specifically brought Dean Powers on board to head up this specia=l investigation so we would have a comprehensive, independent review and in=vestigation of the partnerships in question.""=20Denne added that the board concluded, ""Powers' credentials and reputation i=n the legal field outweigh any perceived legal conflict.""=20It's not the board's view that matters most. It's the public's, and the pub=lic is not likely to trust a report produced by someone with Powers' connec=tions to Enron. Then there are the real people who got hurt -- former Enron= employees, teachers and others who saw their pensions and life savings eva=porate as Enron stock crashed. They are even less likely to trust an inquir=y by Powers.=20Those are legitimate doubts. They already are clouding Powers' investigatio=n and will surely taint his findings -- however reliable they might otherwi=se be.=20Texas' economy will feel aftershocks from Enron's fall.

White, the secretary of the Army, vigorous=ly defended today the business practices of a major Enron division that he =helped manage until early last year, rejecting in an interview assertions b=y former employees that there was improper accounting at the unit.=20Mr. White and Enron officials said that the division, Enron Energy Services=, was getting out of the business of providing energy services to military =bases before Mr. White was named Army secretary last spring. As a result, M=r. White said, he has not needed to disqualify himself from any decisions r=elating to Enron after he took office in May.Several former employees of Enron Energy Services have said that while Mr. =White was vice chairman of the unit, it overstated its profits by hundreds =of millions of dollars, using shoddy accounting practices to create illusor=y earnings. Those assertions have come under scrutiny by several committees= on Capitol Hill investigating Enron's collapse.=20Mr. White denied the ex-employees' accusations. ''As far as I am concerned,= Enron Energy Services was a great business,'' he said in an interview that= ranged widely across military issues and the Enron matter. ''We built it f=rom nothing. There were no accounting irregularities that I was aware of.''==20Questions about Enron Energy Services became public last week with news rep=orts of an e-mail message sent last year by a former employee, Margaret Cec=oni, to Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman at the time. Ms. Ceconi, a former =sales manager, said that Enron Energy Services had hidden losses on contrac=ts worth more than $500 million.=20''This is common knowledge among all the E.E.S. employees, and is actually =joked about,'' she said in the message, dated Aug. 29, 2001. Since Enron's =bankruptcy filing in December, Enron Energy Services has laid off most of i=ts 1,000 employees and walked away from many of its contracts. Those includ=e a $25 million contract to provide services to Fort Hamilton in New York t=hat Enron won when Mr. White, a retired Army brigadier general, was a compa=ny executive.=20The Army is in negotiations with Enron Energy Services over its default on =the Fort Hamilton contract.=20Other former employees have said that the division used aggressive projecti=ons and accounting to overstate earnings during Mr. White's tenure. The emp=loyees said that they did not know whether Mr. White or Lou L. Pai, the uni=t's chairman at the time, were aware of this.=20On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to Mr. =Lay asking him to explain what Enron did in response to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail= message.=20Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the investigatio=ns subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, also raised q=uestions about Mr. White's financial ties to Enron in a letter to the Offic=e of Government Ethics. Mr. Levin's office said today that he had not recei=ved a response from the ethics office.=20In the interview today, Mr. White dismissed Ms. Ceconi's claims of impropri=eties, and he argued that most of her e-mail message was devoted to complai=nts about how the company had treated her. Her personal complaints seemed v=alid, he said, though he suggested that the management team that succeeded =him was responsible for her problems.=20''I think she has a case from what I know about it and what I've read about= it that her employment at Enron was not properly handled,'' Mr. White said=. ''She was recruited into a specific area of the business, and the new lea=dership team at Enron Energy Service decided to head the business in a new =direction. Unfortunately, she got caught in the middle of it.''=20In the e-mail message, Ms. Ceconi said she was recruited to leave her job a=t GE Capital by Enron Energy Services with promises of a compensation packa=ge worth as much $1 million a year. Instead, she was laid off in less than =a year as the company began to crumble. Ms. Ceconi did not return calls for= comment.=20While Mr. White was at Enron Energy Services, the company created a unit ca=lled Enron Federal Solutions that aggressively pursued contracts with the P=entagon to provide energy services at military bases. Congress had authoriz=ed the privatization of utility services at bases in 1997, and the followin=g year the secretary of defense, William S. Cohen, ordered the armed servic=es to try to privatize electric, natural gas and other utilities at all bas=es by 2003.=20A spokeswoman for Enron Energy Services said that by March 2001, before Mr.= White was nominated to be Army secretary, the division had already decided= to stop bidding on military contracts. At the time, the company had bid on= five contracts to provide services to about a dozen bases, including some =Army bases.=20When Mr. White took office, he strongly endorsed the Army's energy privatiz=ation policy. Some consumer groups, including Public Citizen, have raised q=uestions about possible conflict of interest.=20In a letter last week to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the =ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, Mr. White sai=d he had been in contact with 13 different Enron employees, including Mr. L=ay, on 29 occasions since taking office. But Mr. White said that all of tho=se contacts had been personal in nature.=20Today, Mr. White said that no decisions regarding Enron had come to his off=ice. ''I have taken no action at any point or at any time that would benefi=t Enron corporations in any way with utilities privatization or any other e=ndeavor,'' he said.=20According to government disclosure filings, Mr. White's final salary at Enr=on was $5.5 million. To comply with ethics rules, he was compelled to sell =405,710 shares of Enron last year at prices ranging from $50 to $12.85 a sh=are, well below the stock's peak. Still, he received $12 million.=20''I guess I would say that there is a terrible tragedy that has unfolded th=ere,'' Mr. White said today. ''I have many friends, as well as myself, who =have suffered losses.''Photo: Thomas E. White, the secretary of the Army and a former Enron execut=ive, has defended his conduct at the failed company.

The Democrats have not yet cho=sen their Senate candidate.In the advertisement, an announcer intones that Mrs. Dole said she had put =her campaign on hold in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks but then= nine days later flew to ''a secret fund-raiser'' given by Mr. Lay. ''Tell =Elizabeth Dole we expect the truth,'' the announcer says.=20Mary Brown Brewer, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole, called it ''sad that the De=mocrats have already resorted to personal attack ads.'' Ms. Brewer added, '='It's this kind of bitter partisanship and reckless negativity that voters =are tired of.''=20The commercial -- unusual at a time when both parties are still holding pri=mary contests in North Carolina -- comes as Democrats have begun trying to =use the Enron collapse to portray the Bush administration and Congressional= Republicans as tied to wealthy special interests.=20Ms. Brewer took issue with the Democrats' advertisement. She said Mrs. Dole= flew to Houston in late September to speak to a Christian women's group, t=hen went to the fund-raiser. She said that it was not secret and that Mrs. =Dole would give all contributions from Enron, its executives or its employe=es to a fund for Enron employees. She said that about $5,000 raised at the =Houston event came from Enron.=20Until now, Democrats had largely used Enron as a metaphor and as a way of r=aising doubts about Republican policies.=20''I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget,'' Se=nator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said this month, speaking about the= reappearance of federal deficits.=20In a Jan. 28 memo to Democrats, three prominent Democratic strategists, Sta=n Greenberg, James Carville and Bob Shrum, said the Enron collapse ''has th=e potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact othe=r issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and the Republica=ns.''=20They wrote that polls showed that the more people heard about the company, =''the more corrosive it becomes.''=20''This is an issue where Democrats ought to talk about right and wrong, gre=ed and responsibility,'' they wrote.=20More than a dozen Congressional investigations into Enron are under way.

Lay, the chief execut=ive who resigned last week, had at least five meetings with administration =officials to discuss energy. Yet the company's record on shaping the admini=stration approach is mixed.=20Energy experts and lobbyists say Enron had reason to celebrate some of the =administration's recommendations, especially its efforts to create a nation=wide electricity transmission grid. But the energy plan rejected or ignored= many other Enron priorities, including the company's hopes of expanding th=e use of natural gas, controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and stripping= states of their control of electricity transmission lines.=20''It never looked like an Enron wish list to me,'' said Jonathan Weisgall, =Washington representative for MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a utility compan=y that also lobbied to shape the administration's energy policies.=20''There were some things they and many other companies wanted that showed u=p there,'' Mr. Weisgall said. ''On some things Enron wanted the most, they =got nothing at all.''=20Take electricity transmission. Because Enron specialized in trading supplie=s of electricity, it pushed for years to create a more open, less-regulated= transmission grid that would allow it to buy or sell electricity regardles=s of where the power was produced.=20In interviews last spring with The New York Times and the PBS program ''Fro=ntline,'' Mr. Lay said that removing transmission bottlenecks was critical =to the company. ''It's the high-voltage backbone for the electric industrie=s,'' he said. ''It's kind of like a superhighway system for electricity.'' =(Fresh excerpts from the interview will be broadcast tonight on the PBS pro=gram ''Now With Bill Moyers.'')=20An Enron memo drafted before Mr. Lay met Mr. Cheney to discuss energy polic=y in April expanded on the company's transmission goals. The memo, a copy o=f which Enron gave The Times last spring, called transmission failures a bi=g reason ''the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not= yet reached consumers.''=20The final energy report reflects some of Enron's positions. The administrat=ion said it would urge federal regulators to promote open transmission. It =also called for a new, self-regulatory body to oversee transmission grids, =as Enron wanted.=20Enron also asked the Bush administration to agree to seize private land for= construction of more transmission towers. The energy plan endorsed that id=ea.=20But the administration declined to pursue the most aggressive of Enron's re=commendations. Enron wanted the states to lose any jurisdiction over transm=ission and proposed to have federal regulators take full control because th=ey would presumably break up regional monopolies. But the energy plan endor=sed no such action.=20Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat whose inquiries pro=mpted the General Accounting Office inquiry last spring, argues that Enron'=s apparent influence was so sweeping that a thorough investigation was need=ed into how the administration compiled the energy plan.=20Last month, Mr. Waxman identified 17 items in the report that he said benef=ited Enron. He added that ''numerous policies in the White House energy pla=n are virtually identical to the positions Enron advocated.''=20Yet some energy experts and lobbyists said that most of the items were not =specific favors for Enron, but broad policy goals that reflected a consensu=s of many energy companies, including Enron's competitors. When Enron's pol=icy goals did not enjoy broad support, the company often struck out.=20As a natural gas trader, Enron has long promoted the use of natural gas ove=r coal. It has even advocated that the government cap carbon dioxide emissi=ons by power plants as a way of encouraging utilities to switch to cleaner-=burning natural gas. Enron also hoped to profit by trading emission rights.==20The administration did not deliver for Enron on these counts.=20On other issues, Enron's track record was uncertain. During the California =energy crisis last year, the administration pleased Enron and other energy =traders by taking a strong stand against caps on electricity prices. The ad=ministration also selected two candidates backed by Mr. Lay to serve on the= Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees electricity trading.==20But after the two Republican commissioners took office, they quickly adopte=d a plan to impose price controls in California. Some experts argue that th=is step eased price spikes and denied continued high trading profits to Enr=on and other companies.=20Still, some critics said that even if the substance of the administration's= energy policies did not always meet Enron's expectations, they often mirro=red longstanding industry goals and neglected the concerns of environmental=ists and consumer groups.=20''It was the lips of industry to the ear of God,'' said Mark Cooper of the =Consumer Federation of America.

But shareholder activis=ts say weak regulatory requirements, along with a faltering stock market, a=re leading to unchecked growth in executive retirement plans and other bene=fits even as lower-ranking workers face losses and cutbacks in their own pl=ans.=20""The trend has been [for executives] to be greedier and greedier, even thou=gh there's a recession,"" said Cynthia Richson, director of corporate govern=ance for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. ""All this is designed to =keep executives whole while the rank and file loses ground.""=20As many workers' 401(k) retirement plans shrink, executives at some compani=es get guaranteed returns on their investments. Other companies pour hundre=ds of millions into special executive-only retirement accounts. Firms also =pay for big insurance policies and offer executives multimillion-dollar loa=ns, complete with below-market interest rates and a company promise to forg=ive some of the payments.=20Unlike salaries, bonuses and stock options--which must be laid out in gover=nment filings--the true cost of these benefits is often difficult, if not i=mpossible, for outsiders to determine, said Ken Bertsch, director of corpor=ate governance for TIAA-CREF, the world's largest pension fund manager.=20For a variety of accounting and regulatory reasons, companies often are not= required to report the price tag for many of their executive benefits to t=he Securities and Exchange Commission. When benefits are disclosed, their c=osts can be tucked into footnotes or lumped into a catchall category of ""ot=her compensation,"" said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, which =tracks compensation trends.=20The costs of many executive retirement plans are particularly easy to hide,= since companies have to reveal few details, compensation experts said.=20""The regulatory disclosure rules are so weak, [companies] can get away with= one or two ambiguously worded sentences in the middle of a paragraph about= the rank-and-file [retirement] plan,"" Richson said.=20These feeble disclosure requirements, combined with poor stock market perfo=rmance, have spawned a cottage industry in the last year of compensation co=nsultants who are promoting supplemental executive retirement arrangements,= benefits experts said. These plans are designed and promoted specifically =as a way to enhance compensation that's ""off the radar screen of shareholde=rs,"" Richson and other compensation experts said.=20Unlike stock options or bonuses, which are tied to the company's performanc=e, executives benefit from these supplemental retirement plans whether or n=ot the company does well.=20Executives can lose these retirement benefits if the company declares bankr=uptcy, since the plans are not protected by the government-run Pension Bene=fit Guaranty Corp. But shareholder activists say most executives are at lit=tle risk because relatively few companies actually go broke.=20Companies say they need to offer ample benefits to attract and retain top-f=light managers. In addition, many of the plans designed for rank-and-file w=orkers don't provide enough retirement pay for executives used to living on= much higher salaries, compensation consultants said.=20Traditional pension plans limit benefits to highly paid executives because =the plans can take into account no more than $200,000 of salary when determ=ining benefits. The IRS also requires companies to cap the 401(k) contribut=ions of their highest-paid workers, so many executives are prevented from m=aking the full $11,000 annual contributions the law otherwise allows.=20About 60% of the executive retirement plans Mercer surveyed in 1998 made up= for the benefits that otherwise would have been lost to IRS rules, said Ja=net M. Den Uyl, head of executive benefits and compensation for William M. =Mercer Inc., a compensation consultant.=20The 40% of companies that offer richer plans--either to all their executive=s or to their top one or two leaders--often are trying to lure talent from =other firms or prevent defections, Den Uyl said.=20The richest arrangements of all, not surprisingly, are aimed at the compani=es' top leaders.=20""There's more license at the CEO level,"" Den Uyl said. Most CEOs already ha=ve rich compensation packages, ""and they're not ready to throw those away"" =when hired by a new company.=20Here are some of the non-salary perks companies have made available to top =managers:=20* Guaranteed returns on investment. Top executives at Enron could contribut=e salary and bonuses to so-called deferred compensation accounts with guara=nteed minimum annual returns of 12%. Struggling telecom-equipment giant Luc=ent Technologies Inc. has a similar plan that promises to pay five percenta=ge points more than the 10-year Treasury rate. Currently, that Treasury rat=e is about 5%, which means Lucent executives in the plan get a 10% return o=n their investments.=20Enron and Lucent are far from alone. About half the companies that offer de=ferred compensation plans provide a guaranteed minimum return, according to= a Mercer study.=20* Bigger company matches. The typical company match for a 401(k) defined co=ntribution plan is 50 cents for every dollar the employee contributes, up t=o 6% of the worker's salary. For a worker who takes full advantage of the c=ompany match, the employer's contribution represents 3% of his or her pay, =or $1,500 a year for a worker making $50,000.=20The company contribution for an executive version of a 401(k) is typically =60% higher. The average company contributes 5%, and nearly half of the comp=anies surveyed contribute even more, the Mercer study found.=20The dollar amounts contributed can be substantial. Intel Corp. contributed =$1.3 million to the defined contribution accounts of its top five executive=s in 2000, including nearly $400,000 to the account of Chief Executive Crai=g R. Barrett, whose salary and bonuses that year totaled $3.4 million. But =unlike many other firms, Intel makes such contributions for all of the abou=t 10,000 employees whose ability to contribute to the regular 401(k) is res=tricted, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said.=20* Huge low-cost loans. SEC filings show telecom company Global Crossing Ltd=., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, made an $8-million loan= to then-Chief Executive Thomas J. Casey in November 2000 and a $1.8-millio=n loan to President David Walsh in March 2001. Both loans were secured by t=he executives' homes, but the interest rates they paid--6.01% for Casey, 4.=75% for Walsh--were three to four percentage points below prevailing rates =on standard home equity loans at the time.=20Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, frequently tapped a $7.5-mi=llion line of credit he could repay with company stock that Enron had given= him or that he had purchased with low-cost company-provided options. His p=redecessor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, was given a $2-million loan. Enron had off=ered to forgive the payments if Skilling stayed with the company until Dec.= 31, 2001, but he resigned Aug. 14.=20* Lavish life insurance. Many workers get some life insurance through their= employers--typically $50,000 or one year's pay.=20Executives can get much more. About one-quarter of companies in the Mercer =study have special executive life insurance programs that typically pay for= coverage equal to three to four times the executives' annual pay.=20Sometimes the benefit is much higher. In 2000, Cendant Corp., a travel and =real estate company, paid $3.7 million in premiums on a $100-million life i=nsurance policy for its chief executive, Henry R. Silverman, 60. Under the =arrangement, known as a split-dollar policy, Cendant will recoup its premiu=ms from the life insurance proceeds when Silverman dies, with Silverman's h=eirs receiving the rest of the money, according to Cendant's latest SEC fil=ing.=20* Company-paid taxes. Companies pay a variety of tax bills for certain exec=utives. When benefits are so great that they incur a tax bill from the IRS-=-as they often do--some executives are given money to pay the tax. Because =that cash payment also incurs income tax, companies often add an additional= sum to cover the extra tax--a process known as ""grossing up.""=20Lucent Chairman Henry B. Schacht was given $57,325 to pay tax on ""certain f=ringe benefits"" in 2000, according to the company's SEC filings. Ray R. Iri=tani, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, was reimbursed $486,918 for =taxes in 1999--and $95,000 for tax preparation services, SEC filings show.==20* Fringe benefits. Other perks, such as the personal use of corporate jets,= company-provided chauffeurs and company-paid financial planning, can add t=ens of thousands of dollars to an executive's total compensation.=20The footnotes of Lucent's SEC filings show the company paid $26,351 for per=sonal financial planning advice for Schacht in a year in which he received =a $1.1-million paycheck. At Enron, Lay's personal use of a corporate jet in= 2000 was worth $334,179.=20Shareholder activists note that many of the most lavish arrangements have b=een uncovered at companies that have since hit hard times--among them Enron=, whose compensation philosophy, according to SEC filings, was ""to reward e=xecutive performance that creates long-term shareholder value.""=20""At a minimum, it's inconsistent for companies and executives to just keep =feasting"" when financial performance falters, stock prices drop and other e=mployees face cutbacks, Richson, of the Wisconsin Investment Board, said.

So maybe it's a= good time to rescue ethical behavior from the professional ethicists.=20We've come in for criticism lately because one of our contributors, the Bri=tish conservative writer Roger Scruton, wrote an essay for our European edi=tion while being paid by a Japanese tobacco company. The British Guardian t=urned up an e-mail in the name of his wife and business partner Sophie to J=apan Tobacco proposing an increase in their retainer, in return for placing= articles in the ""WSJ, the Times, the Telegraph, the Spectator, the Financi=al Times, the Economist"" and so on.Now, Professor Scruton -- a free-marketeer with well-known views -- was a c=ontributor for us long before he took a dime from Big Tobacco. His point of= view is of course precisely why the left-wing Guardian wants to portray hi=m as tainted by filthy lucre. These are the same ethicists who lack the sam=e passion for disclosure when it comes to finding out, for example, whether= Ralph Nader is financed by trial lawyers.=20Our own view is that the financing of the advocate matters far less than th=e quality of the advocacy. But our long-time standard is also that such fin=ancial ties should be disclosed, so readers can make up their own minds. Mr=. Scruton had an obligation to tell us and his readers about his tobacco fi=nancing when he was writing about tobacco issues; he didn't, and so he will= be taking a holiday from our pages.=20Meanwhile, the Internet ethicist, Andrew Sullivan, has been denouncing any =journalist who's ever taken a dollar from Enron. This includes our contribu=tor Peggy Noonan, who disclosed last week in her OpinionJournal.com column =that she billed Enron $250 an hour for 100 to 200 hours of speech-writing w=ork. In other words, she got paid like any other contract employee, which i=s called business between consenting adults. The first time she wrote about= Enron for us was also when she disclosed her Enron fees, so she has nothin=g to apologize for.=20Certainly not to Mr. Sullivan, who recently wrote a fine piece for this pag=e on the failure of Talk magazine but then without asking re-sold the artic=le to the Times of London, which didn't bother to give us credit. Mr. Sulli=van's explanation is that he didn't think we had international publication =rights, although The Wall Street Journal Europe is distributed in London. L=eaving aside the fine points of copyright law, Mr. Sullivan's behavior may =not have been ""unethical"" but it wasn't very nice.=20Which brings us to a larger point this page has often made about conflicts =of interest and honesty. Avoiding the first is not the same as the latter; =sometimes persnickety rules can become a license for larger dishonesty.

Mr. Taylor, a 24-year-old computer program=mer from Oakland, Calif., put down the puppet he was wrestling and tried to= stifle his indignation.=20''If you want to know what those young crazy radical activists are up to, y=ou've come to the right place,'' he said, glancing around a vast industrial= space buzzing with politically minded artisans and packed with their handi=work. ''I'm really getting sick of that question.''While the police on the streets seemed to be steeling themselves for civic =unrest, the atmosphere yesterday morning inside the garage, along the West =Side Highway at 57th Street, was anything but martial. The message from Mr.= Taylor and two dozen other volunteers was clear: make art, not war.=20There was, however, a looming sense of panic as the hours passed and the af=ternoon debut of this cardboard pageantry neared. There were robber-baron s=tyle top hats bearing the words ''WEF: We Are All En-Wrong'' and beachball-=sized wine goblets painted like globes that read ''Earth For Sale.''

Two New Yo=rk organizations, Arts in Action and Time's Up, helped put together the mak=eshift workshop.=20But alongside the levity yesterday afternoon there was an undercurrent of f=ear. Many of those planning to join the protests said they were worried abo=ut the potential for violence at the hands of the police. Others said they =were frustrated by journalists' single-minded focus on the potential for Se=attle-style disturbances. ''We're not out there to fight with the police,''= said Payal Parekh, 28, an oceanography graduate student from Boston who wa=s helping to organize the puppet making. ''We're trying to get our voices h=eard but the media is obsessed with security issues.''=20Whether or not their fears are real, even those organizing the puppet works=hop were not taking any chances. Bill DiPaola of Time's Up tried to find a =backup location, just in case something were to go awry. ''You can't be too= careful about these things,'' he said.=20Still, with the demonstration at the Gap at 54th Street near Fifth Avenue a=lready under way, there were more pressing concerns. Clapping to get the ro=om's attention, someone urged the crowd at the garage to head east and ''he=lp animate the images we created.'' A pickup truck was loaded with props; e=veryone else took the crosstown bus. Ten minutes later, the truck pulled up= to the curb at 54th Street and into the arms of the police. ''I promise th=ere are no rocks or bottles,'' one woman joked to an officer who was visibl=y suspicious. ''It's just a bunch of goofy puppets.'' After a brief verbal =tussle and a few tense moments, the police relented, gave the group five mi=nutes to unload and everyone, it seemed, was happy.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We have the finest organization in American business today,"" Ken Lay said in an Aug. 14 e-mail just two months before Enron's long-hidden financial problems surfaced.In an Aug. 27 e-mail, Mr. Lay announced the details of an employee stock option program that spoke of ""a significantly higher price"" for Enron stock in the future. Selling for US$37 a share in August, Enron stock now sells at US68?. The stock was at US$83 a year ago.""It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was prospering and that its stock price would rise,"" Rep. Henry Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, said in a letter Saturday to Mr. Lay.Mr. Waxman released the e-mails along with the letter to Mr. Lay, whose political donations along with those of other Enron executives have made the company U.S. President George W. Bush's biggest financial supporter through two governor's races and the presidential election.Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said the picture for the company was solid in August and that financial problems didn't become clear until later.""Ken Lay was telling the truth"" in August, said Mr. Palmer. ""We had had 21 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, the same number of consecutive quarters of volume growth. Our core business at Enron had never been in better shape.""On Oct. 16, the company acknowledged hundreds of millions of dollars in third-quarter losses and a billion-dollar writedown of its equity, a belated admission that touched off a crisis in investor confidence and sent the company careening toward bankruptcy. The company for several years had kept huge amounts of debt off the company's books in partnerships that had been set up by Enron executives, who collected millions of dollars from the partnerships.Declaring that Mr. Lay sold US$40-million of Enron stock between January and August last year, Mr. Waxman demanded to know whether Mr. Lay was aware of the company's financial vulnerabilities.""If you were not aware of this, please explain whether this was because Jeffrey Skilling or other executives withheld that information from you,"" Mr. Waxman wrote.

By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year. As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit. Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a ""grand-slam great deal"" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a ""perishable commodity."" Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month. Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book. Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility. Mr. McMahon said he feels that ""by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever"" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors. The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as ""the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life."" Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. ""You'll see the churn going away,"" says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has ""significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it."" Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses. UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be ""a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities."" The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed ""neck and neck"" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit. The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections. Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue. --- Anita Greil contributed to this article. --- Journal Link: A four-month timeline listing pivotal events surrounding the fall of Enron is in the Online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks.

"Some points of interest for the week,=20Equity Market Update=20There is a tug-o-war in the market between the crisis in confidence caused =by the Enron debacle and the increasingly positive nature of the economic d=ata. First, let's chat about the Enron fall-out.The market seems to be suffering from a nasty case of Enron-itis, as some o=f the talking heads have called the recent negative sentiment in the market=. Clearly something changed with the bankruptcy of Enron. It is the largest= US bankruptcy ever. There are not one, but two official governmental inves=tigations of the company and further investigations are likely. The bankers=, accountants and the lawyers are also going to get a hard look. What has t=he market particularly bothered is the glaring oversight by Arthur Anderson= (AA), one of the big five accounting firms. Delta Airlines has been using =AA for over 50 years and they are looking for a new auditor. Also, the cred=it rating agencies dropped the ball too. One of them actually upgraded Enro=n's debt a few weeks before its demise. What is the investing public to thi=nk? Who can you trust? Generally, investors understand that the Street's ad=vice needs to be viewed with a critical eye, but the accountants were suppo=sed to be looking out for investors. It certainly makes you say hmmmmm...The market hates uncertainty and the level of uncertainty has increased gre=atly and it is not likely to dissipate for some time. Imagine the discussio=ns at the other accounting firms. Companies are not going to be able to sli=p anything by their accountants from now on. Standards are going to be toug=hened up and that may cause some pain for companies that have pushed the en=velope in the past. In addition, the market is going to search and destroy =every company that has Enron-like qualities. Off-balance sheet partnerships= or structures, complicated financial statements and foreign domiciled tax =structures. It started almost right away with the decimation of Enron's com=petitors, Williams (WMB), El Paso (EP), Mirant (MIR) and Calpine (CPN), who= have had to sell assets and issue stock in order to repair their balance s=heets. Some of those companies are trading as if we will never need power o=r natural gas again (EP is my favourite among these companies, as you know)=. Next, the market had its day or so with the asbestos-infected companies a=nd then more recently proceeded to anyone with off-balance sheet assets or =a history of accounting indiscretions. We had better get used to this sort =of roller-coaster existence. With over 6,000 hedge funds, a hyper-active me=dia and market information available 24/7, the witch hunts will continue. S=till, it is important to note a few things:=20First, not all companies with off-balance sheet items are guilty of transgr=essions and not every company that acquires others for a living (a la Tyco)= violates standard accounting principles. In fact, nobody has proven (yet) =that Tyco has done anything improper. The risk of impropriety makes people =sell, not the fact.Second, regardless of whether your company is guilty of doing anything nast=y, if it plays in the same sand-box as a company that attracts the ire of i=nvestors, it is going down. Period. Full stop. No matter if it is guilty of= anything or not. These are market events not business events. Consider the= pain and suffering experienced by El Paso (EP) thanks to Enron or Viacom (=VIA.b) thanks to Haliburton (HAL) and its asbestos exposure. Viacom bought =CBS which owned Westinghouse once upon a time, but that did not stop the st=ock from getting pasted even though it is insured and reserved up the wazoo= ('up the wazoo' is a technical term signifying a significant amount).Third, emotions and sentiment can push stock prices around a great deal in =the short term, but over the long term, stock prices are determined by a co=mpany's ability to generate cash. The best opportunities are likely to come= from buying companies with low debt levels that are relatively free of con=troversy, but have been beaten up because they resemble another company wit=h a real problem. Biovail (BVF), Viacom (VIA.b), El Paso (EP), etc. However=, each of these names also comes with an increased risk profile as a result= of the market's heightened sensitivity to 'issues' (accounting, asbestos, =debt levels, litigation, etc.).=20On the economic front, the data seems to be point to an economic recovery t=hat is already underway.=20Consumer confidence rose from 94.6 to 97.3 in January and was up for the se=cond straight month. The index is now above the pre-September 11 level. Als=o the expectations component of the index was the highest in over a year, s=uggesting that consumer spending should continue to hold up well.=20Durable Goods orders rose in December and importantly the ex-transportation= orders rose for a third month in a row, the longest streak of gains in 4 y=ears.=20New home sales rose stronger than expected and taken together with last wee=k's existing home sales, total home sales were above 6.1 million (annualize=d) and stable.=20Today, the unemployment rate fell to 5.6% and the 4-week moving average of =jobless claims fell to its lowest level since August; and the ISM (NAPM) in=dex came in at 49.9 vs. 50.0 expected and new orders remained above 50, ind=icating order volume is expanding.=20Finally, on the international front, the German Business Confidence index r=ose and is now close to its pre-September 11 level.=20Unfortunately, Japan continues to struggle. The Japanese unemployment rate =rose to a record high 5.6% and real wage-earning household spending fell 4.=4% compared to last year. Both figures were worse than expected and the dro=p in household spending does not bode well the prospects of an economic rec=overy. Also, the yen continues to slide as confidence in the government and= the economy wanes. The Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31st and there i=s widespread concern that the country's banks will have to mark down the va=lue of more loans and investments, potentially pushing some of them into ba=nkruptcy. Of course, a number of bankruptcies would be a good thing much li=ke the S&L crisis was for the US in the early 1990s. A cathartic cleansing =followed by an audible flush could lead to a great buying opportunity. Stay= tuned.Financials - The US banks are trading very poorly - no wonder. Credit quali=ty, which everybody knew was bad, has turned out to be at least as nasty as= expected or worse. PNC Financial (PNC) had to restate its earnings when th=e SEC forced the company to consolidate 3 subsidiaries, K-Mart (KM) filed f=or chapter 11, Global Crossings (GX) shuts its doors, and today, the 2nd bi=ggest European cable company defaulted on $6.4 billion in debt and preferre=d stock. When you add these events on to the Enron scenario, it makes inves=tors of all kinds hold a bit more cash, a few more government bonds and a l=ittle less equity. This is the kind of pain that is quite typical for the t=rough of the credit cycle. As you know, JP Morgan (JPM) has been a recommen=ded stock for many quarters, however it looks like it will be removed from =the US Focus List as it has broken our technical screen. The stock remains =buy or strong buy rated around the Street and a great deal of bad news woul=d seem to be already priced into the stock. However, the risk of further ne=gative credit events seems quite high, and as a result, we suggest that new= money go into Citigroup (C), which is trading at just under 14x 2002 EPS v=s. its historical range of about 12x to 20x. Out anlayst's comments on Sun =Life (SLC) suggest this is a name we should continue to accumulate.Sun Microsystems (SUNW) is under pressure following negative comments by Me=rrill. According to Merrill, recent comments by ORCL's Larry Ellison give c=ause for concern about SUNW's high-margin Unix server mkt; ORCL is replacin=g 3 Unix servers with a cluster of INTC servers running Linux; concern is t=hat SUNW's Unix biz will be attacked from below by INTC servers running NT =or Linux (particularly Linux, as it's easier to learn than SUNW's Solaris o=perating system). Microsoft (MSFT) was added to Goldman Sachs portfolio and= Oracle (ORCL) was removed.=20Calpine (CPN) was downgraded to Deutche Bank to BUY from Strong Buy due to =a lack of near-term catalysts in the stock; current risks include: continue=d weakness in power prices and spark spreads, the California DWR contract r=enegotiations, a highly leveraged balance sheet, and a tight cash flow situ=ation. Price target is $20. We should get used to reading recommendations l=ike this one. The list of risks is large and imposing and yet many of you w=ill notice that the target is $20 suggesting a 72% return is possible over =the next 12 months. We would encourage investors to focus on the risks and =the likelihood of them happening rather than a highly subjective target.In Canada, focus on Focus List names Sun Life (SLC) and Shaw Communications= (SJR.b). Suitability is everything, never more so than in the current mark=et environment.Interest Rate Update=20The big, but not so surprising news yesterday was the decision by the FOMC =to keep the Fed funds rate steady at 1.75%, while the discount rate remaine=d at 1.25%.  also as expected, the Fed maintained their easing bias.  This =was the first ""no change"" following an FOMC meeting since Dec/00, after 4.7=5%  of cuts in 11 steps through 2001.  The committee noted that there are ""=signs that weakness in demand is abating and economic activity is beginning= to firm have become more prevalent"".  This is different from the last comm=ent on Dec 11 when they stated ""weakness in demand shows signs of abating, =but those signs are preliminary and tentative"".  The easing bias was justif=ied due to the uncertainty of the strength in business capital and consumer= spending.  RBC CM Economics believe that this statement will be a sign of =things to come, with rates in a holding pattern, and an easing bias remaini=ng, until the recovery is firmly and sustainably in place.  They are callin=g for the first hike to occur no earlier than September. - Fed funds future=s are pricing in earlier expectations - the July contract is indicating a 1=00% chance of a 25 bps hike.Stocks are the bigger news with Nasdaq stock futures up 10.50 pts after an =upgrade to Intel by Merrill Lynch, gains in Oracle after the company reaffi=rmed its profit target, and Applied Materials stating that a bottom has com=e and gone for the industry.=20Have a good weekend and be good,=20Rod.",rod.kennedy@rbc.com,"kennedy@enron.com, rod.kennedy@rbc.com",,,Market / Economic Update,"\ExMerge - Dorland, Chris\Inbox",2002-02-01 13:27:30-08:00

"Dear Ken: When the timing is right, I would like to visit  with you (and Linda if appropriate) to discuss my idea of writing a scholarly  but lively history of Enron.  My working title is Ambition: The Rise and  Fall of Enron.  Perhaps the ""Fall"" is premature, but it will be revised  accordingly if a stunning comeback is achieved.  One of the advantages of a  longer book is that the last chapter will be on industry developments a year or  two out to see there things really land with or without Enron. What I have in mind is a two-year research and  writing project--or longer.  It would develop your history through  Transco and then begin when John Duncan recruited you to Enron.  The  history, unlike the books we are likely to see in the next year,  would fully develop a number of energy, political economy, and corporate  culture themes.  I will, of course, bring in all the recent and  forthcoming events as the climax, but the buildup is what will distinguish  the book.  I anticipate it would be akin to ""The Prize,"" but instead of the  ""epic quest for oil, money, and power"" the Enron story would be the ""epic""  or ""fatal"" quest to create the world's leading company. This is a book for history.  The operative  word is understanding.  The book is not intended to preserve Enron's  legacy or your legacy per se but to teach the world about what happened and  why.  There will be many positives in the story but there will be  negatives--maybe a lot of negatives.  I will be happy to discuss some  of my hypotheses of the negatives and sensitivities with you up  front.  I truly believe that a totally candid analysis of the situation is  the best legacy that Enron or you can bequeath to the business and public policy  world.  Personally for all of us who have been hurt, it is the best  foundation to move forward and once again hang our heads high.  The past  cannot be undone.  (And interestingly, there is a remarkable historical  precedent for what happened to Enron and you in the energy-centered story  of Samuel Insull--so you have pretty good company.) I heard through the grapevine that you are thinking  of writing your own book.  That is a good idea for several reasons.   But I want to discuss what my book would be about in the hopes that I can  interview you over the course of the research and writing.  If  so, your autobiography could come after my book where you face up  to all the tough questions and have the ""last say.""  You would also  have a secure foundation from my book with all your  accomplishments. I have about a month to finish a detailed  outline of the book and produce some writing samples.  An agent will shop  the proposal around, and we will see if the advance is enough to proceed.   (I got fairly wiped out by the crash.)  I am also investigating having  a co-author involved on the ""Fall"" side, while I work on the ""Rise""  side.  I also might get some foundations or investors involved to make the  economics work, and the early indication is that there will be support.  A  lot of people would be very supportive of a full history rather than what  we are likely to see in the next year. I have a PowerPoint presentation on the potential  book and will be happy to visit with you.  It might be better to visit at  the Huntington, but the office is fine also.

"Dear Mr. Lay:You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.  I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.  Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.  I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.  Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.  With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.  However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.  I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.  Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.  I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.  I knew that since I was a ???survivor???, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ???critical employee???.  But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.  I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.  I was fortunate.  I found something immediately.  I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.  I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.  I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.  I was mistaken.  When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.  After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources.  I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ?? years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation.  I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation.  I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??"" that way they were assured $4,500.  I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month.  Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to.  What are the rules?  How should these situations have been handled?  Should not each employee be treated fairly?  Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay.  I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron.  I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down.  However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??"" ones that have yet to be recognized.  All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me.  I earned my vacation.  I worked hard and supported this company ??"" and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars.  I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future.  I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful.

"X-Origin: BECK-SX-FileName: sally beck 1-28-02.pstBeth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of =the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one o=f our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mi=d and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured= into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that th=ere could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had s=ecured our first services customer and were to begin providing these servic=es on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during Nov=ember and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much int=erest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people)=, but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enr=on that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to ""w=in again"" as Enron. =20Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the= formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts withi=n EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if= we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal s=tage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea wou=ld be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could pro=vide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  Wit=h the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron empl=oyees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this ""in=dependent"" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estat=e could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon =the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced co=sts for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of th=e CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other =services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that f=or the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true caree=r opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting= firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained. =20Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There =is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We a=sked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, an=d I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this=.  Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our ho=pe would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around =that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted. =20The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due dili=gence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consid=eration.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  I=t would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be =followed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit= to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Credit=or's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bid=ding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting fi=rm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process. =20Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally",sally.beck@enron.com,jeffrey.mcmahon@enron.com,"X-From: Beck, Sally </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SBECK>","X-To: McMahon, Jeffrey </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmcmaho>",Services Company,"X-cc: Perlman, Beth </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bperlman>, Piper, Greg </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gpiper>",2002-01-04 17:19:48-08:00
