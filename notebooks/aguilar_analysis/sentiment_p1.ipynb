There's close to 15 million people here, so it shouldtake a while for them to get to me if they go at 13 people increments.Inappropriate joking aside, what an awful thing.  I wonder at thestrange sort of logic that compels the bastards.  I hope they met asgrisly an end as the ones their handing out.Did you get my picture?  Looking forward to the basket of goodies.

We are going to have a number of people who will want to come in at least Thursday or Wednesday before the wedding and others who will want to come in an entire week before and will not want to switch hotels. Therefore, I'm not sure it is going to work. Further, they are requiring the three night stay beginning on Friday and we have a number of Argentines who will want to leave on Sunday but will be charged for Sunday night. Sooo, we are back at square one and trying to find another place for everything. I don't want to cancel the Ritz just yet, but if we can book rooms for the week before the wedding and the weekend of the wedding at the Four Season and if you can suggest a really great place to have the reception, that may be what we have to do.  Can you please advise me on your suggestions.Thanks, Liz\n",

We are tentatively planning to issue the release Monday , October 11, but in case word leaks to the media from Cole's meetings with local landowners starting tomorrow, we may need to issue this week.  With that in mind, would you please provide me any comments on the attached document by the end of the day tomorrow, October 6.Please note that this project has received tremendous local resistance to date, so we are quoting Cole and adding much more information about the local benefits to try to address these issues.  We are drafting a Q&A document and key message points for use with local and national media and the investor audience.\n",

With that in mind, would you please provide me any comments on the attached document by the end of the day tomorrow, October 6.Please note that this project has received tremendous local resistance to date, so we are quoting Cole and adding much more information about the local benefits to try to address these issues.

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\n",

Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

Hesaid policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills aretripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But healso said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and othershad provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E(which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create adeferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn'tprotect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the marketbased solutions.

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi.

Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

      "47: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

They assure us verbally that they intend to honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

      "60: Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organizationTo: Cindy Olson@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EEScc: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Job Titles and Job BandingFrom reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.Wade\n",

      "62: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

The Mayor has asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.  As outlined in my December 6th memo -- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $500,000 for the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999.  The $250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.  The Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at the time.  Will we be sponsoring the event?Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC in February 2000.Please let me know if you need additional information.Thank you.\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

      "166: Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organizationTo: Cindy Olson@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EEScc: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Job Titles and Job BandingFrom reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.Wade\n",

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

In the meantime, I would answer the question as follows: Enron will continue to focus its attention on the commercial, light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. Enron continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a couple of years ago (for example, the  rising acceptance of online purchasing by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential markets). We believe, however, that the residential market opportunity is best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron  Mary Clark@ENRON04/20/2000 02:31 PMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EEScc:  Subject: Annual Meeting Q&ASteve, we need to include a potential question in the Q&A document that addresses if Enron will get back into the residential business (i.e. Resco).

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.  I am, however, still trying to make it for the 16th.  Perhaps we can reschedule our meeting sometime on the 16th.  Fallon and I are meeting at 8:30 on the 17th to discuss the project also.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

You may have gotten by mistake a shorter version which you can discard.---------------------- Forwarded by Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/02/99 08:10 AM ---------------------------Terence H Thorn12/02/99 08:08 AMTo: Maureen McVicker@EEScc:  Subject: Maureen- would you distribute this note Friday morning  to everyone who participates in the Friday call. Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "191: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

We met w/ Shashi Patel of Steve's group today and discussed that there are competitors out there, including OATI, Alstom ESCA (who are partnered with Ross Perot).  Ross Perot has approached Enron about promoting its system in the Midwest ISO.   We used this system for Enron control area's EMS.  Ross Perot is going to contact Steve Kean to set up a meeting to show us his product.  Also, Kevin Presto thinks that OATI would be a good investment.Steve Kean--Steve Horn and Shashi Patel are interested in being included in a presentation by Perot.Sarah and Joe--Can you think of any FERC regulatory constraints that would limit Enron's ability to invest in one of the software providers to utilities/RTOS?

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the Midwest ISO.  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron supporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.  The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.  The consortium's primary competitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO environment (similar to California and PJM). ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/10/99 01:05 PM ---------------------------\"dsgeorge\" <dsgeorge@earthlink.net> on 09/09/99 11:00:36 PMTo: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, \"Lloyd Will\" <LWill@hydro.mb.ca>cc: \"John Wulf\" <john.wulf@alstom.esca.com>, \"Brent Brobak\" <Brent@esca.com>, \"Laurence Ferry\" <laurence.ferry@esca.com>, \"JD Hammerly\" <jd.hammerly@esca.com> Subject: Midwest ISO information...Kevin and Lloyd,The Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow:Allegheny PowerAmeren (formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company)CILCOCinergyCommonwealth EdisonHoosier Energy Rural Electric CooperativeIllinois PowerKentucky UtilitiesLouisville Gas & ElectricNorthern States PowerWabash Valley PowerWisconsin ElectricThe status of the formation is anti-profit, i.e. a holding pattern is inplace with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years.  The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you mightexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as ProgramManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging andCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCAfor the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters ouroffering and provides more near-term opportunity.Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharinginformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand howeach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.

      "198: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. JoeJoe Hillings09/08/99 11:57 AMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok Mehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)Subject: India And The WTO Services NegotiationSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment.A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

If you could be so kindas to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=tpoint, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=ethat a business-group would host an event, which could include a wideraudience of business people of Houston.  After having spoken with the Germa=nConsulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, itunfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater HoustonPartnership, whose President was on vacation last week.  I would welcome an=yassistance in getting us in contact with them.  Probably it would not taketoo many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea ofpromoting our ideas.

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\n",

They assure us verbally that they intend to honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.  I am, however, still trying to make it for the 16th.  Perhaps we can reschedule our meeting sometime on the 16th.  Fallon and I are meeting at 8:30 on the 17th to discuss the project also.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\n",

Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. JoeJoe Hillings09/08/99 11:57 AMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok Mehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)Subject: India And The WTO Services NegotiationSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment.A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

      "379: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the Midwest ISO.  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron supporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.  The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.  The consortium's primary competitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO environment (similar to California and PJM). ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/10/99 01:05 PM ---------------------------\"dsgeorge\" <dsgeorge@earthlink.net> on 09/09/99 11:00:36 PMTo: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, \"Lloyd Will\" <LWill@hydro.mb.ca>cc: \"John Wulf\" <john.wulf@alstom.esca.com>, \"Brent Brobak\" <Brent@esca.com>, \"Laurence Ferry\" <laurence.ferry@esca.com>, \"JD Hammerly\" <jd.hammerly@esca.com> Subject: Midwest ISO information...Kevin and Lloyd,The Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow:Allegheny PowerAmeren (formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company)CILCOCinergyCommonwealth EdisonHoosier Energy Rural Electric CooperativeIllinois PowerKentucky UtilitiesLouisville Gas & ElectricNorthern States PowerWabash Valley PowerWisconsin ElectricThe status of the formation is anti-profit, i.e. a holding pattern is inplace with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years.  The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.

This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

      "392: Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organizationTo: Cindy Olson@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EEScc: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Job Titles and Job BandingFrom reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.Wade\n",

      "394: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. JoeJoe Hillings09/08/99 11:57 AMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok Mehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)Subject: India And The WTO Services NegotiationSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment.A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

      "537: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.

The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you mightexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as ProgramManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging andCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCAfor the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters ouroffering and provides more near-term opportunity.Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharinginformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand howeach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.

      "547: Summary of what we discussed the other night:Background:power -- power prices have moved above $1000/mwh in the Northwest and are showing $600-700 for the first quarter of 01; forward prices in California have also moved well above the \"soft cap\" of $150.  Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.

I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

      "563: A \"dedicated room\" isn't as bad as it sounds.  It would not be in use full time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already have).  Let me know what you think.  Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving deeper into her group (and next to her files)).---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 12/17/99 08:40 AM ---------------------------Sarah Palmer@ECT12/15/99 05:26 PMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marie Hejka/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Dedicated eSpeak RoomSteve and Mark:eSpeak is gaining tremendous momentum to become the communication vehicle for Enron's business units. In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

      "650: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the Midwest ISO.

The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.

The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you mightexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as ProgramManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging andCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCAfor the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters ouroffering and provides more near-term opportunity.Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharinginformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand howeach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London.

Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.

      "677: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I love his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number is 888 524 1326.Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a fax machine this weekend.

      "688: X-bcc: X-Folder: \\Kenneth_Lay_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documentsX-Origin: LAY-KX-FileName: klay.nsfI wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent contribution requests.Tom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us from Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from multi-year gifts toward programs.Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation have each contributed $1 millionBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic department.On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to fund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & Opportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the library.  We have chosen to decline this request.I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.\n",

As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record first for the GV into Houston.I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well as our thoughts and recommendations.  Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.

      "728: X-bcc: X-Folder: \\Kenneth_Lay_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\ElizabethX-Origin: LAY-KX-FileName: klay.nsfI wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent contribution requests.Tom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us from Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from multi-year gifts toward programs.Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation have each contributed $1 millionBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic department.On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to fund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & Opportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the library.  We have chosen to decline this request.I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.\n",

      "730: Mr. Lay,  I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off today.  As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record first for the GV into Houston.I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well as our thoughts and recommendations.  Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the Global Express.  Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on your India trip in December.All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to support Enron into the new millennium.\n",

From the minarets of far away mosques, themuezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys andstreets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, amiserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the localmuezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds usthat God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important thansleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simplylisten, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back overme.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitchesitself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and Iargue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out ofreach.Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd theirway into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which meansthere's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before Idouse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself ofthe theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated withsleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fearI am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for somethingworth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages ofa quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when Ireally get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I reallydo have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my Englishlesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably madeany more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.                               *     *     *My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internetserver, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.

(I read that in Cairoyou could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastictarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, ingarbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfumeof car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of thebarnyard.And, today, the slaughter began.Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of theolder neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorouslychopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recentlyskinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animalin a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, nodoubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to imagesfrom Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's headunder a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking aboutstretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skinof a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a waterballoon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feedcontentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised tosee that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going onright next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaultedby a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put hisfingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car andwipe it on the license plate.The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, secondonly Ramadon (\"Ramazon\" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (\"hac\"in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means areto make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folksget at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During theholiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animalfor sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of itto others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateurbutcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an \"expert\"do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick andpainless as possible.The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and wasallowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about beliefand faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  Ican see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  Itcertainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story ofGod's sacrifice of his son.As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was aslaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Younggirls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran aroundthe streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  Ipassed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holdingher mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pileof discarded intestines.April 5, 1999My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bitsanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it'sonly that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bitmore discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at leasta  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including ripplingmuscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught andcleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our\"knowledge\" and \"experience\" comes secondhand through the media,including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If ourrituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves withdisintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close tototally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have everbeen.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeededonly in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul'schagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get achance to see just how long those legs are.Hope all is well.

AudenThe view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of redtiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other sideof the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalledand polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to becalled Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly sixcenturies before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear ofapartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlinesof towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman theMagnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered bythe before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but alreadyappearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, Isuppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far toolittle and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about therelevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybethousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip andrise in the air space between me and all of that.I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my windowwhile playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  Thisevening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by SteveEarle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long agolove (\"Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?\") and one by LucindaWilliams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (\"When I getto Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you\").  A pile of clouds staacked upon the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sunstill makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch theneddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappearsbehind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be headingin that same direction.What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've everdeveloped particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that isnot to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore SanFrancisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it wouldhave been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convincemyself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling downin one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of mylife is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all mightlead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'mjust looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I'vefound it.My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home afterwhat was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sureabout the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) Iaccosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but theytried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the firsttime I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on apost-dusk walk through the \"working class\" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on ourway to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the SuleymaniyeMosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularlypoorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in neartotal darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasionalflare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first notknowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passingnear a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely importantinstitution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have beentold) have no showers.Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha andNina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while sufferingthrough the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of mostsignificance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine monthsapart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  Duringone of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordynever-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building andlasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when Isuggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood spacebetween an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understanddepartment.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan onstudying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles andwriting and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb moredeeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, includingan incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this olddog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where tolay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is\"hearing\" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are \"Ne dediniz [What didyou say]?\" and \"Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?\".)  Iwill be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television isan important way to learn how to \"hear\" Turkish.Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writingprogram, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.(\"Insallah [With god's help].\")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and myreading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least Ishould be sending a few more e-mails.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "757: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeff,I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was acting under the direction of individuals running the program.The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of Simon's situation.In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time and energy on each individual case.  Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would like to discuss at your convenience.Thanks Charlene\n",

The muezzin's voice seems fuller,more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity inmy neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precautionagainst fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relativelyuntouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking thesquare surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partiallyblocking the road that circles the square.Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, thefirst a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began thismorning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building offits foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, itsroof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severedneatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildingsflattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steelreinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms offriends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves hermicrophone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trappedthere, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debrisabove.I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and Ihad spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under treeswhose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by SultanMahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over thecorrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke ofwriting, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, aboutlearning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter alongthe coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with theworst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our livesover, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in mybed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips thatare many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2am.It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm notsure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggeringdeeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in SanFrancisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it gotreally bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, andwhatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and soundsconfused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that therewere other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in myhallway, where three doorways were close together.The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells likewaves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all likethe comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my buildingbeing all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd newangles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imaginethat things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of therelatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soonthe shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then Ireally started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked withadrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, aflashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- andI had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even mycamera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was offby the time I opened my door a minute or two later.My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off toone side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it fora quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light hereand there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning acrossthe Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes ofa few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  Iworked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may havecollapsed.I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gatheredin the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though Ioccasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  Atone point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along IstiklalCaddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricitybeing out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidenceof the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, anabandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, inone hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (whichas I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, mostwere huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the womenwere wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? nextto the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people thereand, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty ofso miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may havecollapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were aseries of fairly significant aftershocks.On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has beenrescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appearsunscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking himquestions.  Were you scared?  \"Cok kokum [very scared]!\"  He seems pleasedto be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is askedabout his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  \"Annem [my mother],kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].Duydum!\"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  \"Sesleriduydum!  Sesleri duydum!\"Turkiye, iyi sanslar.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normalloads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxedby the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the sufferingwill be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lotof suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solidground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spenttwo of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and havebeen able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, everyopen space not too close to a building seems to be filled with peoplesleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between thingstrees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets maderelatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me howkind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of onepoor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindelymisplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And whatyou read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard byRussian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkeyall the luck in the world.  It will need it.Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot ofwhat they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.More later.

Turkey has a population ofsome 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The percapita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hitso hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the lastfew decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago towhat some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who movedfrom the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of thecorner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which todistribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try theAmerican Red Cross,  P.O.

      "767: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of thequake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (Ihad already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, includingpreparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  OnTuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hourstotal.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizingwhat I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for anewspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is ajournalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writingthe other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though Ialready knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I wenthome that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in themorning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add upto?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion inbetween.Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There areprobably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday'spaper(!).By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don'tget a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everythingwas all right, but got no reponse to that question.)

The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, butquickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some ofthe original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflectanything about yours truly.  Later.At The Galata Tower CafeCigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs inthe air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughtsabout teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.\"Take it easy\", it says with a smirk.  \"Relax.\"  A phony look of concernclouds it further.  \"What about taking a deep breath?\"  Surreptitiously(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has driftedin closer, notices.  \"There!  Isn't that better?\"\"No\", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to takethis internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through oneparticularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  \"Now get lost!\"Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way homefrom school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which isamplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone wallssurrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the hugetower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare outthe window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards ofthe tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  Thetower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entireneighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of thedurability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressivecharacteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, bythe slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), itstands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half asbothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubtbeen subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so yearhistory.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square tore-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm theonly one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have toserve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't botherthem, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's playhas a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basictraining.I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next tome. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, formy benefit, his version of the question \"More tea?\"  (He has given up onwords, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)\"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With alittle milk, please.]\"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, Iagree  [and have been told before] too many \"lutfens\".  There areprobably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.I'll work on perfecting them, \"sonra [later]\".) Yusuf nods, walks away.I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I musthave made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of thetables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is thebeginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitchedwail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poorthing, I look away.For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take aclose look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. \"Dikkat! [Watchout!]\")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which issurprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which areseriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle ofeach table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a cornerof the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scenefrom somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, ithas aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappearedamongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  Thegreen of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it isapproaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color ofthe mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the teaserved here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto thesand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as ifsomeone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed anddistorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedlystirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from havingwalked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long agosurrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearingclothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn justone more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreamingperhaps of little more than an early spring.I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,surprisingly, begin to relax.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It's a firstperson piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, alot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeatingmyself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to getit out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fellduring the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.Happy holidays,Mark-O*  *  *     Christmas Day, Istanbul     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronouncedwords rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earthto die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,the story sounds strange and almost subversive.     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christianand Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent byGod, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed'sprophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistakenelevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing abig, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announcesthat we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and inEnglish, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyricsare basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?tocome?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorlytranslated chorus, which asks for the Son of God \"to come will be born inour heart?.     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to theservice.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I amsure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in thesanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first serviceof the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italianand a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, willoverflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consistmostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently somemembers of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, sincemany of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even beingforced to stand out in the cold.     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month ofRamadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one candiscern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during theninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solarcalendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started wellbefore dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who wasroaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummershave been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A traditionoriginating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is torustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal beforethe sun comes up.     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the yearfor Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which somesay influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Totalremission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I havebeen told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all theTurks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with whatI have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell methey fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling allsorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they aresignificantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, manyof the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful andeat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbinga simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning andeating them on my way to work.     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in theStates.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enoughCatholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really muchtoo strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little morethan an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local PresbyterianChurch (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with mytwin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often strugglefor the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemedsusceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to seeif any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light beingshown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeatthat light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinitedarkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given thatI am so far from what I am most familiar.     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I leanover toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids underhis breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,straighten back up, listen to the song begin.     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes awhile for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomesparticularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As ifsomething ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space thatenvelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  Iam moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel atear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the peoplehere are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to bereminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that isitself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the firsttime since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to takecommunion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that wewalk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there Iam surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonderwhere they might have been hiding.Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  Anolder woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder howshe can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at leastpretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about thechurch, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not wantto be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return tomy seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, soincongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view allthis, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other insuch an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions havecome up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live herewill be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhapsexchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shotsheard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, theIftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, wherespecial Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- atleast to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques andthe hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls toprayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleepunder the same black sky.\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" * * Translation from the Bible.\"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!The compassionate, the merciful!King on the day of reckoning!Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.Guide Thou us on the straight path,The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are notangry, and who go not astray.\" ** ** Translation from the Koran.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

From the minarets of far away mosques, themuezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys andstreets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, amiserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the localmuezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds usthat God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important thansleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simplylisten, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back overme.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitchesitself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and Iargue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out ofreach.Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd theirway into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which meansthere's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before Idouse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself ofthe theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated withsleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fearI am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for somethingworth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages ofa quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when Ireally get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I reallydo have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my Englishlesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably madeany more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.                               *     *     *My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internetserver, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.

(I read that in Cairoyou could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastictarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, ingarbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfumeof car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of thebarnyard.And, today, the slaughter began.Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of theolder neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorouslychopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recentlyskinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animalin a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, nodoubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to imagesfrom Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's headunder a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking aboutstretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skinof a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a waterballoon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feedcontentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised tosee that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going onright next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaultedby a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put hisfingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car andwipe it on the license plate.The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, secondonly Ramadon (\"Ramazon\" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (\"hac\"in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means areto make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folksget at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During theholiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animalfor sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of itto others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateurbutcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an \"expert\"do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick andpainless as possible.The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and wasallowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about beliefand faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  Ican see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  Itcertainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story ofGod's sacrifice of his son.As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was aslaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Younggirls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran aroundthe streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  Ipassed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holdingher mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pileof discarded intestines.April 5, 1999My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bitsanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it'sonly that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bitmore discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at leasta  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including ripplingmuscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught andcleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our\"knowledge\" and \"experience\" comes secondhand through the media,including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If ourrituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves withdisintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close tototally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have everbeen.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeededonly in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul'schagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get achance to see just how long those legs are.Hope all is well.

AudenThe view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of redtiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other sideof the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalledand polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to becalled Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly sixcenturies before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear ofapartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlinesof towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman theMagnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered bythe before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but alreadyappearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, Isuppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far toolittle and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about therelevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybethousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip andrise in the air space between me and all of that.I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my windowwhile playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  Thisevening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by SteveEarle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long agolove (\"Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?\") and one by LucindaWilliams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (\"When I getto Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you\").  A pile of clouds staacked upon the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sunstill makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch theneddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappearsbehind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be headingin that same direction.What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've everdeveloped particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that isnot to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore SanFrancisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it wouldhave been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convincemyself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling downin one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of mylife is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all mightlead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'mjust looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I'vefound it.My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home afterwhat was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sureabout the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) Iaccosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but theytried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the firsttime I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on apost-dusk walk through the \"working class\" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on ourway to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the SuleymaniyeMosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularlypoorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in neartotal darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasionalflare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first notknowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passingnear a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely importantinstitution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have beentold) have no showers.Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha andNina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while sufferingthrough the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of mostsignificance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine monthsapart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  Duringone of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordynever-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building andlasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when Isuggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood spacebetween an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understanddepartment.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan onstudying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles andwriting and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb moredeeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, includingan incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this olddog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where tolay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is\"hearing\" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are \"Ne dediniz [What didyou say]?\" and \"Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?\".)  Iwill be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television isan important way to learn how to \"hear\" Turkish.Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writingprogram, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.(\"Insallah [With god's help].\")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and myreading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least Ishould be sending a few more e-mails.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "791: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeff,I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was acting under the direction of individuals running the program.The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of Simon's situation.In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time and energy on each individual case.  Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would like to discuss at your convenience.Thanks Charlene\n",

Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probablyonly us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in thestreets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up onsolid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad constructionhere; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment halfa block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparentinjuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not solucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed hada generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying,men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in themiddle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks inneighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much Ilearned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, whichis depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door;mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; muchlike after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in mysubconscious.Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  Mayneed it.Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll sendthis to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok andworried about them worrying about me.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The muezzin's voice seems fuller,more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity inmy neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precautionagainst fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relativelyuntouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking thesquare surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partiallyblocking the road that circles the square.Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, thefirst a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began thismorning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building offits foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, itsroof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severedneatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildingsflattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steelreinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms offriends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves hermicrophone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trappedthere, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debrisabove.I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and Ihad spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under treeswhose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by SultanMahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over thecorrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke ofwriting, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, aboutlearning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter alongthe coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with theworst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our livesover, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in mybed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips thatare many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2am.It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm notsure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggeringdeeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in SanFrancisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it gotreally bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, andwhatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and soundsconfused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that therewere other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in myhallway, where three doorways were close together.The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells likewaves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all likethe comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my buildingbeing all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd newangles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imaginethat things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of therelatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soonthe shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then Ireally started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked withadrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, aflashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- andI had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even mycamera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was offby the time I opened my door a minute or two later.My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off toone side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it fora quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light hereand there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning acrossthe Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes ofa few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  Iworked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may havecollapsed.I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gatheredin the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though Ioccasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  Atone point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along IstiklalCaddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricitybeing out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidenceof the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, anabandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, inone hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (whichas I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, mostwere huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the womenwere wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? nextto the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people thereand, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty ofso miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may havecollapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were aseries of fairly significant aftershocks.On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has beenrescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appearsunscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking himquestions.  Were you scared?  \"Cok kokum [very scared]!\"  He seems pleasedto be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is askedabout his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  \"Annem [my mother],kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].Duydum!\"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  \"Sesleriduydum!  Sesleri duydum!\"Turkiye, iyi sanslar.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normalloads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxedby the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the sufferingwill be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lotof suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solidground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spenttwo of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and havebeen able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, everyopen space not too close to a building seems to be filled with peoplesleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between thingstrees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets maderelatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me howkind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of onepoor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindelymisplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And whatyou read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard byRussian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkeyall the luck in the world.  It will need it.Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot ofwhat they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.More later.

Turkey has a population ofsome 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The percapita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hitso hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the lastfew decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago towhat some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who movedfrom the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of thecorner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which todistribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try theAmerican Red Cross,  P.O.

      "807: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of thequake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (Ihad already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, includingpreparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  OnTuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hourstotal.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizingwhat I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for anewspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is ajournalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writingthe other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though Ialready knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I wenthome that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in themorning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add upto?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion inbetween.Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There areprobably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday'spaper(!).By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don'tget a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everythingwas all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting allright?More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (thoughIhipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20minutes and get ready for my class.Your little brother______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It's a firstperson piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, alot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeatingmyself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to getit out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fellduring the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.Happy holidays,Mark-O*  *  *     Christmas Day, Istanbul     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronouncedwords rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earthto die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,the story sounds strange and almost subversive.     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christianand Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent byGod, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed'sprophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistakenelevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing abig, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announcesthat we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and inEnglish, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyricsare basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?tocome?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorlytranslated chorus, which asks for the Son of God \"to come will be born inour heart?.     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to theservice.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I amsure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in thesanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first serviceof the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italianand a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, willoverflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consistmostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently somemembers of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, sincemany of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even beingforced to stand out in the cold.     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month ofRamadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one candiscern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during theninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solarcalendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started wellbefore dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who wasroaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummershave been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A traditionoriginating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is torustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal beforethe sun comes up.     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the yearfor Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which somesay influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Totalremission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I havebeen told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all theTurks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with whatI have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell methey fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling allsorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they aresignificantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, manyof the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful andeat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbinga simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning andeating them on my way to work.     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in theStates.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enoughCatholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really muchtoo strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little morethan an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local PresbyterianChurch (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with mytwin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often strugglefor the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemedsusceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to seeif any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light beingshown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeatthat light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinitedarkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given thatI am so far from what I am most familiar.     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I leanover toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids underhis breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,straighten back up, listen to the song begin.     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes awhile for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomesparticularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As ifsomething ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space thatenvelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  Iam moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel atear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the peoplehere are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to bereminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that isitself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the firsttime since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to takecommunion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that wewalk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there Iam surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonderwhere they might have been hiding.Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  Anolder woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder howshe can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at leastpretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about thechurch, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not wantto be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return tomy seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, soincongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view allthis, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other insuch an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions havecome up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live herewill be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhapsexchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shotsheard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, theIftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, wherespecial Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- atleast to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques andthe hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls toprayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleepunder the same black sky.\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" * * Translation from the Bible.\"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!The compassionate, the merciful!King on the day of reckoning!Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.Guide Thou us on the straight path,The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are notangry, and who go not astray.\" ** ** Translation from the Koran.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, butquickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some ofthe original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflectanything about yours truly.  Later.At The Galata Tower CafeCigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs inthe air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughtsabout teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.\"Take it easy\", it says with a smirk.  \"Relax.\"  A phony look of concernclouds it further.  \"What about taking a deep breath?\"  Surreptitiously(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has driftedin closer, notices.  \"There!  Isn't that better?\"\"No\", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to takethis internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through oneparticularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  \"Now get lost!\"Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way homefrom school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which isamplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone wallssurrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the hugetower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare outthe window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards ofthe tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  Thetower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entireneighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of thedurability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressivecharacteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, bythe slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), itstands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half asbothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubtbeen subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so yearhistory.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square tore-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm theonly one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have toserve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't botherthem, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's playhas a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basictraining.I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next tome. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, formy benefit, his version of the question \"More tea?\"  (He has given up onwords, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)\"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With alittle milk, please.]\"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, Iagree  [and have been told before] too many \"lutfens\".  There areprobably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.I'll work on perfecting them, \"sonra [later]\".) Yusuf nods, walks away.I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I musthave made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of thetables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is thebeginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitchedwail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poorthing, I look away.For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take aclose look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. \"Dikkat! [Watchout!]\")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which issurprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which areseriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle ofeach table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a cornerof the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scenefrom somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, ithas aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappearedamongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  Thegreen of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it isapproaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color ofthe mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the teaserved here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto thesand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as ifsomeone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed anddistorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedlystirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from havingwalked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long agosurrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearingclothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn justone more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreamingperhaps of little more than an early spring.I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,surprisingly, begin to relax.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

From the minarets of far away mosques, themuezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys andstreets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, amiserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the localmuezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds usthat God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important thansleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simplylisten, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back overme.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitchesitself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and Iargue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out ofreach.Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd theirway into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which meansthere's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before Idouse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself ofthe theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated withsleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fearI am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for somethingworth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages ofa quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when Ireally get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I reallydo have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my Englishlesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably madeany more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.                               *     *     *My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internetserver, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.

(I read that in Cairoyou could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastictarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, ingarbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfumeof car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of thebarnyard.And, today, the slaughter began.Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of theolder neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorouslychopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recentlyskinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animalin a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, nodoubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to imagesfrom Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's headunder a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking aboutstretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skinof a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a waterballoon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feedcontentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised tosee that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going onright next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaultedby a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put hisfingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car andwipe it on the license plate.The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, secondonly Ramadon (\"Ramazon\" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (\"hac\"in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means areto make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folksget at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During theholiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animalfor sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of itto others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateurbutcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an \"expert\"do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick andpainless as possible.The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and wasallowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about beliefand faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  Ican see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  Itcertainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story ofGod's sacrifice of his son.As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was aslaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Younggirls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran aroundthe streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  Ipassed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holdingher mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pileof discarded intestines.April 5, 1999My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bitsanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it'sonly that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bitmore discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at leasta  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including ripplingmuscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught andcleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our\"knowledge\" and \"experience\" comes secondhand through the media,including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If ourrituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves withdisintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close tototally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have everbeen.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeededonly in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul'schagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get achance to see just how long those legs are.Hope all is well.

AudenThe view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of redtiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other sideof the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalledand polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to becalled Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly sixcenturies before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear ofapartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlinesof towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman theMagnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered bythe before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but alreadyappearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, Isuppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far toolittle and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about therelevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybethousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip andrise in the air space between me and all of that.I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my windowwhile playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  Thisevening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by SteveEarle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long agolove (\"Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?\") and one by LucindaWilliams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (\"When I getto Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you\").  A pile of clouds staacked upon the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sunstill makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch theneddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappearsbehind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be headingin that same direction.What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've everdeveloped particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that isnot to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore SanFrancisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it wouldhave been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convincemyself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling downin one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of mylife is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all mightlead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'mjust looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I'vefound it.My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home afterwhat was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sureabout the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) Iaccosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but theytried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the firsttime I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on apost-dusk walk through the \"working class\" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on ourway to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the SuleymaniyeMosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularlypoorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in neartotal darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasionalflare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first notknowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passingnear a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely importantinstitution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have beentold) have no showers.Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha andNina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while sufferingthrough the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of mostsignificance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine monthsapart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  Duringone of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordynever-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building andlasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when Isuggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood spacebetween an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understanddepartment.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan onstudying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles andwriting and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb moredeeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, includingan incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this olddog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where tolay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is\"hearing\" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are \"Ne dediniz [What didyou say]?\" and \"Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?\".)  Iwill be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television isan important way to learn how to \"hear\" Turkish.Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writingprogram, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.(\"Insallah [With god's help].\")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and myreading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least Ishould be sending a few more e-mails.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

Things seem fine here.  Took long walks, one late last nightand one this morning, and saw little eveidence of damage.Saw on CNN that americans say quake 7.8  Unbelievable.My lap top running out of battery, so will just refer you to the below,which was my reponse to my a note from my brother several hours ago.        * * *Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probablyonly us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in thestreets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up onsolid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad constructionhere; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment halfa block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparentinjuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not solucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed hada generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying,men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in themiddle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks inneighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much Ilearned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, whichis depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door;mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; muchlike after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in mysubconscious.Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  Mayneed it.Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll sendthis to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok andworried about them worrying about me.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The muezzin's voice seems fuller,more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity inmy neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precautionagainst fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relativelyuntouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking thesquare surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partiallyblocking the road that circles the square.Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, thefirst a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began thismorning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building offits foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, itsroof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severedneatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildingsflattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steelreinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms offriends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves hermicrophone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trappedthere, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debrisabove.I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and Ihad spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under treeswhose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by SultanMahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over thecorrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke ofwriting, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, aboutlearning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter alongthe coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with theworst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our livesover, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in mybed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips thatare many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2am.It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm notsure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggeringdeeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in SanFrancisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it gotreally bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, andwhatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and soundsconfused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that therewere other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in myhallway, where three doorways were close together.The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells likewaves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all likethe comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my buildingbeing all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd newangles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imaginethat things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of therelatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soonthe shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then Ireally started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked withadrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, aflashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- andI had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even mycamera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was offby the time I opened my door a minute or two later.My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off toone side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it fora quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light hereand there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning acrossthe Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes ofa few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  Iworked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may havecollapsed.I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gatheredin the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though Ioccasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  Atone point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along IstiklalCaddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricitybeing out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidenceof the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, anabandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, inone hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (whichas I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, mostwere huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the womenwere wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? nextto the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people thereand, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty ofso miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may havecollapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were aseries of fairly significant aftershocks.On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has beenrescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appearsunscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking himquestions.  Were you scared?  \"Cok kokum [very scared]!\"  He seems pleasedto be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is askedabout his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  \"Annem [my mother],kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].Duydum!\"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  \"Sesleriduydum!  Sesleri duydum!\"Turkiye, iyi sanslar.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normalloads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxedby the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the sufferingwill be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lotof suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solidground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spenttwo of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and havebeen able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, everyopen space not too close to a building seems to be filled with peoplesleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between thingstrees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets maderelatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me howkind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of onepoor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindelymisplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And whatyou read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard byRussian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkeyall the luck in the world.  It will need it.Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot ofwhat they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.More later.

Turkey has a population ofsome 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The percapita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hitso hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the lastfew decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago towhat some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who movedfrom the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of thecorner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which todistribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try theAmerican Red Cross,  P.O.

      "846: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of thequake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (Ihad already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, includingpreparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  OnTuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hourstotal.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizingwhat I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for anewspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is ajournalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writingthe other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though Ialready knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I wenthome that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in themorning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add upto?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion inbetween.Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There areprobably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday'spaper(!).By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don'tget a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everythingwas all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting allright?More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (thoughIhipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20minutes and get ready for my class.Your little brother______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It's a firstperson piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, alot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeatingmyself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to getit out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fellduring the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.Happy holidays,Mark-O*  *  *     Christmas Day, Istanbul     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronouncedwords rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earthto die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,the story sounds strange and almost subversive.     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christianand Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent byGod, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed'sprophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistakenelevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing abig, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announcesthat we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and inEnglish, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyricsare basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?tocome?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorlytranslated chorus, which asks for the Son of God \"to come will be born inour heart?.     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to theservice.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I amsure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in thesanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first serviceof the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italianand a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, willoverflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consistmostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently somemembers of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, sincemany of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even beingforced to stand out in the cold.     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month ofRamadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one candiscern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during theninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solarcalendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started wellbefore dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who wasroaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummershave been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A traditionoriginating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is torustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal beforethe sun comes up.     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the yearfor Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which somesay influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Totalremission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I havebeen told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all theTurks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with whatI have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell methey fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling allsorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they aresignificantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, manyof the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful andeat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbinga simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning andeating them on my way to work.     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in theStates.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enoughCatholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really muchtoo strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little morethan an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local PresbyterianChurch (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with mytwin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often strugglefor the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemedsusceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to seeif any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light beingshown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeatthat light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinitedarkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given thatI am so far from what I am most familiar.     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I leanover toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids underhis breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,straighten back up, listen to the song begin.     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes awhile for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomesparticularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As ifsomething ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space thatenvelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  Iam moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel atear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the peoplehere are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to bereminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that isitself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the firsttime since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to takecommunion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that wewalk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there Iam surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonderwhere they might have been hiding.Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  Anolder woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder howshe can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at leastpretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about thechurch, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not wantto be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return tomy seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, soincongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view allthis, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other insuch an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions havecome up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live herewill be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhapsexchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shotsheard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, theIftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, wherespecial Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- atleast to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques andthe hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls toprayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleepunder the same black sky.\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" * * Translation from the Bible.\"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!The compassionate, the merciful!King on the day of reckoning!Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.Guide Thou us on the straight path,The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are notangry, and who go not astray.\" ** ** Translation from the Koran.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, butquickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some ofthe original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflectanything about yours truly.  Later.At The Galata Tower CafeCigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs inthe air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughtsabout teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.\"Take it easy\", it says with a smirk.  \"Relax.\"  A phony look of concernclouds it further.  \"What about taking a deep breath?\"  Surreptitiously(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has driftedin closer, notices.  \"There!  Isn't that better?\"\"No\", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to takethis internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through oneparticularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  \"Now get lost!\"Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way homefrom school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which isamplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone wallssurrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the hugetower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare outthe window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards ofthe tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  Thetower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entireneighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of thedurability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressivecharacteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, bythe slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), itstands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half asbothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubtbeen subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so yearhistory.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square tore-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm theonly one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have toserve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't botherthem, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's playhas a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basictraining.I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next tome. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, formy benefit, his version of the question \"More tea?\"  (He has given up onwords, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)\"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With alittle milk, please.]\"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, Iagree  [and have been told before] too many \"lutfens\".  There areprobably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.I'll work on perfecting them, \"sonra [later]\".) Yusuf nods, walks away.I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I musthave made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of thetables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is thebeginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitchedwail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poorthing, I look away.For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take aclose look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. \"Dikkat! [Watchout!]\")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which issurprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which areseriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle ofeach table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a cornerof the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scenefrom somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, ithas aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappearedamongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  Thegreen of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it isapproaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color ofthe mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the teaserved here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto thesand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as ifsomeone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed anddistorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedlystirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from havingwalked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long agosurrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearingclothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn justone more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreamingperhaps of little more than an early spring.I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,surprisingly, begin to relax.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",
