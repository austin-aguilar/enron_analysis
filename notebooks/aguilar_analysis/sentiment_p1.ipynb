We are going to have a number of people who will want to come in at least Thursday or Wednesday before the wedding and others who will want to come in an entire week before and will not want to switch hotels. Therefore, I'm not sure it is going to work. Further, they are requiring the three night stay beginning on Friday and we have a number of Argentines who will want to leave on Sunday but will be charged for Sunday night. Sooo, we are back at square one and trying to find another place for everything. I don't want to cancel the Ritz just yet, but if we can book rooms for the week before the wedding and the weekend of the wedding at the Four Season and if you can suggest a really great place to have the reception, that may be what we have to do.  Can you please advise me on your suggestions.Thanks, Liz\n",

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\n",

Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

But healso said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and othershad provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E(which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create adeferral account).

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi.

Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

      "47: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

They assure us verbally that they intend to honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

You should both be aware that Unocal(?) has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in Pakistan a couple of years ago.  Their claim is that the company did not provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the region.To: Gabriel Sanchez-Sierra/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melinda Winkler@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: Security Assessment Report  Gabriel et al:Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to (and employees in) Colombia have increased.  This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

      "60: Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organizationTo: Cindy Olson@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EEScc: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Job Titles and Job BandingFrom reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.Wade\n",

      "62: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.

      "77: Summary of what we discussed the other night:Background:power -- power prices have moved above $1000/mwh in the Northwest and are showing $600-700 for the first quarter of 01; forward prices in California have also moved well above the \"soft cap\" of $150.  Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

      "166: Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organizationTo: Cindy Olson@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EEScc: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Job Titles and Job BandingFrom reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.Wade\n",

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

In the meantime, I would answer the question as follows: Enron will continue to focus its attention on the commercial, light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. Enron continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a couple of years ago (for example, the  rising acceptance of online purchasing by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential markets). We believe, however, that the residential market opportunity is best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron  Mary Clark@ENRON04/20/2000 02:31 PMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EEScc:  Subject: Annual Meeting Q&ASteve, we need to include a potential question in the Q&A document that addresses if Enron will get back into the residential business (i.e. Resco).

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

Will we be sponsoring the event?Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC in February 2000.Please let me know if you need additional information.Thank you.\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.  I am, however, still trying to make it for the 16th.  Perhaps we can reschedule our meeting sometime on the 16th.  Fallon and I are meeting at 8:30 on the 17th to discuss the project also.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

      "191: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

      "198: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. JoeJoe Hillings09/08/99 11:57 AMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok Mehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)Subject: India And The WTO Services NegotiationSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment.A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\n",

They assure us verbally that they intend to honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.  I am, however, still trying to make it for the 16th.  Perhaps we can reschedule our meeting sometime on the 16th.  Fallon and I are meeting at 8:30 on the 17th to discuss the project also.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

Enron could potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA (and abroad as well). Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel are clearly not the solution for mass transit.Regards,Dave HubbardCuiaba, Brasil011-55-65-612-2102\n",

I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovichis covering FERC.  I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.  Hesaid policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills aretripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But healso said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and othershad provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E(which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create adeferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn'tprotect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the marketbased solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customersshould be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine.\n",

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi.

Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

      "379: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.

They assure us verbally that they intend to honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

You should both be aware that Unocal(?) has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in Pakistan a couple of years ago.  Their claim is that the company did not provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the region.To: Gabriel Sanchez-Sierra/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melinda Winkler@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: Security Assessment Report  Gabriel et al:Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to (and employees in) Colombia have increased.  This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

      "392: Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through.  In the meantime, though, let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved.  As I said in my original message, I am not looking to undo what has been done, but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate.  In fact, one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas, who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America.  Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he, David Haug, and I submit, everyone else on the Exec Comm, understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But, I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title, granted only through the PRC process.  Though I don't personally feel this way, for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure; it implies something like \"making partner\" in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes.  In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media.  I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title, regardless of any change in compensation.  As an executive committee, we elected to make such an exception only for \"legacy\" title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process.  Everyone in my organizationTo: Cindy Olson@ENRON, Steven J Kean@EEScc: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Job Titles and Job BandingFrom reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India, it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind, and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past, I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years.1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example, in India, the title \"Director\" implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP), whereas in the Enron domestic world, it is a position below VP. \"Managing Director\" within Enron is below the most senior levels, but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason, I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card, although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example, in Houston, we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting, particularly India, to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization, an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree, this is form over substance, but that's what works over here.3. To solve some of these problems, Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities, everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager, but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers, such as 1 through 15, because that sounds way too much like the government, but something like that would work. Once this is done, communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then, the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President, all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes.I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus, I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account  the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.Wade\n",

      "394: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.

      "409: Summary of what we discussed the other night:Background:power -- power prices have moved above $1000/mwh in the Northwest and are showing $600-700 for the first quarter of 01; forward prices in California have also moved well above the \"soft cap\" of $150.  Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

The Mayor has asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.

The $250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.  The Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at the time.

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

If you could be so kindas to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=tpoint, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=ethat a business-group would host an event, which could include a wideraudience of business people of Houston.  After having spoken with the Germa=nConsulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, itunfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater HoustonPartnership, whose President was on vacation last week.  I would welcome an=yassistance in getting us in contact with them.  Probably it would not taketoo many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea ofpromoting our ideas.

Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. JoeJoe Hillings09/08/99 11:57 AMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok Mehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)Subject: India And The WTO Services NegotiationSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment.A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

      "537: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the Midwest ISO.  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron supporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.  The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.  The consortium's primary competitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO environment (similar to California and PJM). ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/10/99 01:05 PM ---------------------------\"dsgeorge\" <dsgeorge@earthlink.net> on 09/09/99 11:00:36 PMTo: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, \"Lloyd Will\" <LWill@hydro.mb.ca>cc: \"John Wulf\" <john.wulf@alstom.esca.com>, \"Brent Brobak\" <Brent@esca.com>, \"Laurence Ferry\" <laurence.ferry@esca.com>, \"JD Hammerly\" <jd.hammerly@esca.com> Subject: Midwest ISO information...Kevin and Lloyd,The Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow:Allegheny PowerAmeren (formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company)CILCOCinergyCommonwealth EdisonHoosier Energy Rural Electric CooperativeIllinois PowerKentucky UtilitiesLouisville Gas & ElectricNorthern States PowerWabash Valley PowerWisconsin ElectricThe status of the formation is anti-profit, i.e. a holding pattern is inplace with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years.  The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.

They assure us verbally that they intend to honor the twenty minutes whenever possible.  This could possibly be addressed in a cover letter so that if it is abused we can open up the agreement again.  A copy of the cover letter would goto NERC and SERC.  They also refuse to let us aggreate schedules.  The IDC language was taken out but replaced with language eliminating any impact on commercial arrangement.  Again, even though a cover letter may not be an official part of an agreement I believe, if we reach any agreement we should explain our expectations where they are not clearly defined in the agreement in a cover letter to SERC and NERC.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT on 10/06/99 12:00 AM ---------------------------\"Whitley, Stephen G.\" <sgwhitley@tva.gov> on 10/05/99 04:46:11 PMTo: \"Satterfield, Gail B.\" <gbsatterfield@tva.gov>, \"'jmaughn@serc1.org'\" <jmaughn@serc1.org>, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: \"Boston, W.

      "547: Summary of what we discussed the other night:Background:power -- power prices have moved above $1000/mwh in the Northwest and are showing $600-700 for the first quarter of 01; forward prices in California have also moved well above the \"soft cap\" of $150.  Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest.gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers.curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.  In any event, they have already made the commitments in our binding MOU.  This issue is not a deal breaker but it is contributing to the delay.  Right now we are scheduled to meet with them in NY Tuesday the 14th through Thursday the 16th.  As a result, I can not be in Houston on the 15th as planned.

These are the items I left Ken a voicemail about.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 12/15/99 05:29 PM ---------------------------Carolyn Cooney@ENRON12/15/99 12:11 PMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EES, Elizabeth Linnell/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Governor Ridge might call Ken Lay todayI just received a call from Bob O'Dell (215-569-5312) following up on the request from Mayor Edward Rendell regarding the upcoming Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show and Philadelphia 2000.  The Mayor has asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.  As outlined in my December 6th memo -- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $500,000 for the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999.  The $250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.  The Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at the time.  Will we be sponsoring the event?Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC in February 2000.Please let me know if you need additional information.Thank you.\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

      "563: A \"dedicated room\" isn't as bad as it sounds.

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

      "650: I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 09/10/99 01:17 PM ---------------------------Mark Schroeder@ECT09/10/99 05:26 AMTo: Margaret Carson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Joan Wasylik/LON/ECT@ECT, Danny McCarty/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy EconomistsMargaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.  Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.  I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n",

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the Midwest ISO.

The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.

The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you mightexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as ProgramManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging andCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCAfor the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters ouroffering and provides more near-term opportunity.Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharinginformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand howeach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.  These items include the following:1.  Native load language2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.  3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.  Generation is deregulated.5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.  Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.18. Utility worker protection plan.Below for your information is the plan.At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.Janine\n",

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/99 09:12 AM ---------------------------Keith Jones12/16/99 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".  All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.  The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n",

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n",

Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.  Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n",

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/99 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out  by Control Risk  .

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above.

Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n",

The DPUC issued a final compliance decision (attached) Thursday approving the ENA prices and removing the draft language that would have released special contract customers.The bad news is that we are falling behind in finalizing the agreements with UI.  Mostly this is due to unavailability of some of the UI personnel.  The one business issue that is causing a bit of concern on their end is a fear that they have promised us too much in the way of an option on their nuclear generation.

      "677: Steve,Here are some thoughts on why I think this is important. (sorry for the length)PoliticalOne of the the main problem that I see with electricity reform and its \"benefits\" for the poor would mainly have to do with the redesign of subsidy policy.  Subsidies should be focused to the consumer.  In general, electricity rates in developing countries are highly subsidized.  If there is a change in the cost structure the benefits will show in the government finances, that is, if you do not raise the rates for the residential users (especially for the poor).  In the Mexican proposal it is not clear what they plan to do with the subsidies, but if they make a mistake it will become a social problem.  I think there is an opportunity here but it requires the advice of economic experts.EconomicAnother way in which we could try to make an argument that electric reform benefits the poor is that it does so in two indirect ways:1.  Lower electric rates and quality of service for industrial users will enhance a competitive industry which will be able to grow in a globalized world or at least offer better prices for their products in the local economy.  Lower electric costs decrease th cost of one of the supplies hence enabling the producer to reduce or not to raise prices resulting in a lower inflation rate.  A growing industry creates more employment...2.  Private investment in the electric sectors will create employment but the most important aspect is that it will take away a heavy weight off the back of the government's finance.  The government could then re- direct resources that it would have invested in the energy sector or use resources from the sale of assets to develop water infrastructure, pay foreign debt, give micro credits, build roads, improve health and education,.....Social development (poverty)There are another aspects that are directly related to the availability of energy services for the poor:  heating and cooking and waterAlthough most of the developing world has tropical or semi tropical weather and is less subjected to cold weather (hot weather generally will not kill you) they have some heating needs apart from the energy for cooking needs.  It is frequent that dung is used as fuel for heating and cooking purposes with terrible effects on health which in turn results in lower productivity , etc.  The available alternative to dung is wood and here the problem is even worse because these poor communities end up causing irreversible damage to the forests and then to the soil and finally to their water resources (since the forest sustains the soil and prevents water from causing erosion.  When the forest dissapears water is not filtered down to natural storages underground) As you can see its a mess.One other extremely important aspect of the availability of energy for the poor is that it enables them to have potable water delivered as close as possible to their communities.  In the poorest communities little girls do not go to school because they have to carry the water buckets home.  They do not get an education.  The terrible thing about it is that the education level of the mother is what can have a highest impact in the quality of life of a poor family.  This is very sad and energy plays a huge part in the solution.A lot could be researched and written on this matters and about the role of energy in the solution of these problems.  Can we  help?  Do we have the resources that need to be commited to at least one of these aspects?  Which one do you think will have the highest impact?Best,Ricardo\n",

Thanks.TAgain I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group.  Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates.At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff scheduleFeed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels.  Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of  experiences we've seen in Europe.Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda.Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line.Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way.Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went.What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry:   an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut outOpen markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned.Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes.It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true.We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job.We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future.Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen.We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th.I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects.Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.\n",

      "688: X-bcc: X-Folder: \\Kenneth_Lay_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documentsX-Origin: LAY-KX-FileName: klay.nsfI wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent contribution requests.Tom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us from Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from multi-year gifts toward programs.Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation have each contributed $1 millionBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic department.On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to fund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & Opportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the library.  We have chosen to decline this request.I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.\n",

      "691: Mr. Lay,  I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off today.  As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record first for the GV into Houston.I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well as our thoughts and recommendations.  Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the Global Express.  Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on your India trip in December.All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to support Enron into the new millennium.\n",

We are working to balance these requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from multi-year gifts toward programs.Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation have each contributed $1 millionBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to support renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've conducted some research to determine what other local corporations are contributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In fact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind contributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I am particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at the University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy services agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic department.On a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to fund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & Opportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  They indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather have Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the library.  We have chosen to decline this request.I apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you updated on the status of these various requests.  I will present recommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.\n",

      "712: Mr. Lay,  I have received the proposal from Gulstream and will drop it off today.  As you probably already know, the flight from Beijing was a record first for the GV into Houston.I have met and discussed the possibility of the GV replacing a 900B or a total fleet transition at length with John Stabler, Ron Fain and Keith Jones.  I have prepared a spread sheet showing the affect on budget as well as our thoughts and recommendations.  Although the cabin size of the Global Express is larger, Gulfstream is a good two years ahead of the Global in deliveries and fleet size.  They have overcome the mechanical problems that were experienced earlier in the program,  problems that  the Global Express may still be facing.  Worldwide support and operational experience have the Gulfstream far ahead of the Global Express.  Bombardier is still looking forward to demonstrating their aircraft to you on your India trip in December.All of us at the department stand ready to do whatever you feel necessary to support Enron into the new millennium.\n",

In addition, we've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's gift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very appreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.YMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined Enron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and Linda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, of course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips of the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming opportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to Enron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  The downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them allowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)Other Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital contribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several ways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's interest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit institutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much larger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these requests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  Finally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as well as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these requests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from multi-year gifts toward programs.Texas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. Denton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for a new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building will bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish glass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build and equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and education.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to specify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation have each contributed $1 millionBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several folks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many programs in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our existing medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They also outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific dollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have contributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are within the $100,000 to $500,000 range.University of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you know, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to support renovation of the library.

From the minarets of far away mosques, themuezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys andstreets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, amiserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the localmuezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds usthat God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important thansleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simplylisten, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back overme.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitchesitself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and Iargue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out ofreach.Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd theirway into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which meansthere's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before Idouse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself ofthe theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated withsleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fearI am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for somethingworth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages ofa quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when Ireally get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I reallydo have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my Englishlesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably madeany more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.                               *     *     *My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internetserver, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.

(I read that in Cairoyou could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastictarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, ingarbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfumeof car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of thebarnyard.And, today, the slaughter began.Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of theolder neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorouslychopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recentlyskinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animalin a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, nodoubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to imagesfrom Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's headunder a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking aboutstretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skinof a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a waterballoon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feedcontentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised tosee that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going onright next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaultedby a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put hisfingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car andwipe it on the license plate.The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, secondonly Ramadon (\"Ramazon\" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (\"hac\"in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means areto make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folksget at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During theholiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animalfor sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of itto others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateurbutcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an \"expert\"do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick andpainless as possible.The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and wasallowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about beliefand faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  Ican see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  Itcertainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story ofGod's sacrifice of his son.As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was aslaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Younggirls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran aroundthe streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  Ipassed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holdingher mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pileof discarded intestines.April 5, 1999My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bitsanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it'sonly that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bitmore discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at leasta  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including ripplingmuscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught andcleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our\"knowledge\" and \"experience\" comes secondhand through the media,including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If ourrituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves withdisintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close tototally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have everbeen.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeededonly in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul'schagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get achance to see just how long those legs are.Hope all is well.

AudenThe view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of redtiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other sideof the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalledand polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to becalled Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly sixcenturies before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear ofapartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlinesof towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman theMagnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered bythe before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but alreadyappearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, Isuppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far toolittle and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about therelevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybethousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip andrise in the air space between me and all of that.I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my windowwhile playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  Thisevening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by SteveEarle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long agolove (\"Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?\") and one by LucindaWilliams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (\"When I getto Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you\").  A pile of clouds staacked upon the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sunstill makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch theneddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappearsbehind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be headingin that same direction.What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've everdeveloped particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that isnot to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore SanFrancisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it wouldhave been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convincemyself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling downin one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of mylife is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all mightlead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'mjust looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I'vefound it.My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home afterwhat was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sureabout the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) Iaccosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but theytried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the firsttime I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on apost-dusk walk through the \"working class\" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on ourway to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the SuleymaniyeMosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularlypoorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in neartotal darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasionalflare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first notknowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passingnear a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely importantinstitution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have beentold) have no showers.Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha andNina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while sufferingthrough the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of mostsignificance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine monthsapart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  Duringone of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordynever-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building andlasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when Isuggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood spacebetween an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understanddepartment.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan onstudying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles andwriting and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb moredeeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, includingan incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this olddog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where tolay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is\"hearing\" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are \"Ne dediniz [What didyou say]?\" and \"Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?\".)  Iwill be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television isan important way to learn how to \"hear\" Turkish.Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writingprogram, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.(\"Insallah [With god's help].\")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and myreading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least Ishould be sending a few more e-mails.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

Things seem fine here.  Took long walks, one late last nightand one this morning, and saw little eveidence of damage.Saw on CNN that americans say quake 7.8  Unbelievable.My lap top running out of battery, so will just refer you to the below,which was my reponse to my a note from my brother several hours ago.        * * *Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probablyonly us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in thestreets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up onsolid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad constructionhere; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment halfa block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparentinjuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not solucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed hada generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying,men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in themiddle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks inneighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much Ilearned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, whichis depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door;mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; muchlike after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in mysubconscious.Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  Mayneed it.Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll sendthis to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok andworried about them worrying about me.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "757: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeff,I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was acting under the direction of individuals running the program.The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of Simon's situation.In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time and energy on each individual case.  Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would like to discuss at your convenience.Thanks Charlene\n",

The muezzin's voice seems fuller,more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity inmy neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precautionagainst fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relativelyuntouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking thesquare surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partiallyblocking the road that circles the square.Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, thefirst a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began thismorning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building offits foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, itsroof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severedneatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildingsflattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steelreinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms offriends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves hermicrophone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trappedthere, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debrisabove.I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and Ihad spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under treeswhose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by SultanMahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over thecorrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke ofwriting, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, aboutlearning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter alongthe coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with theworst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our livesover, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in mybed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips thatare many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2am.It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm notsure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggeringdeeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in SanFrancisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it gotreally bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, andwhatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and soundsconfused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that therewere other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in myhallway, where three doorways were close together.The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells likewaves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all likethe comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my buildingbeing all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd newangles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imaginethat things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of therelatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soonthe shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then Ireally started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked withadrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, aflashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- andI had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even mycamera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was offby the time I opened my door a minute or two later.My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off toone side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it fora quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light hereand there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning acrossthe Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes ofa few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  Iworked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may havecollapsed.I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gatheredin the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though Ioccasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  Atone point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along IstiklalCaddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricitybeing out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidenceof the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, anabandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, inone hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (whichas I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, mostwere huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the womenwere wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? nextto the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people thereand, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty ofso miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may havecollapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were aseries of fairly significant aftershocks.On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has beenrescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appearsunscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking himquestions.  Were you scared?  \"Cok kokum [very scared]!\"  He seems pleasedto be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is askedabout his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  \"Annem [my mother],kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].Duydum!\"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  \"Sesleriduydum!  Sesleri duydum!\"Turkiye, iyi sanslar.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normalloads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxedby the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the sufferingwill be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lotof suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solidground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spenttwo of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and havebeen able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, everyopen space not too close to a building seems to be filled with peoplesleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between thingstrees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets maderelatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me howkind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of onepoor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindelymisplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And whatyou read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard byRussian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkeyall the luck in the world.  It will need it.Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot ofwhat they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.More later.

Turkey has a population ofsome 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The percapita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hitso hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the lastfew decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago towhat some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who movedfrom the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of thecorner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which todistribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try theAmerican Red Cross,  P.O.

      "767: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of thequake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (Ihad already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, includingpreparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  OnTuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hourstotal.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizingwhat I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for anewspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is ajournalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writingthe other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though Ialready knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I wenthome that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in themorning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add upto?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion inbetween.Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There areprobably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday'spaper(!).By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don'tget a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everythingwas all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting allright?More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (thoughIhipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20minutes and get ready for my class.Your little brother______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, butquickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some ofthe original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflectanything about yours truly.  Later.At The Galata Tower CafeCigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs inthe air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughtsabout teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.\"Take it easy\", it says with a smirk.  \"Relax.\"  A phony look of concernclouds it further.  \"What about taking a deep breath?\"  Surreptitiously(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has driftedin closer, notices.  \"There!  Isn't that better?\"\"No\", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to takethis internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through oneparticularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  \"Now get lost!\"Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way homefrom school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which isamplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone wallssurrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the hugetower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare outthe window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards ofthe tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  Thetower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entireneighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of thedurability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressivecharacteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, bythe slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), itstands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half asbothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubtbeen subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so yearhistory.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square tore-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm theonly one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have toserve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't botherthem, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's playhas a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basictraining.I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next tome. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, formy benefit, his version of the question \"More tea?\"  (He has given up onwords, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)\"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With alittle milk, please.]\"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, Iagree  [and have been told before] too many \"lutfens\".  There areprobably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.I'll work on perfecting them, \"sonra [later]\".) Yusuf nods, walks away.I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I musthave made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of thetables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is thebeginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitchedwail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poorthing, I look away.For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take aclose look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. \"Dikkat! [Watchout!]\")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which issurprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which areseriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle ofeach table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a cornerof the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scenefrom somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, ithas aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappearedamongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  Thegreen of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it isapproaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color ofthe mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the teaserved here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto thesand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as ifsomeone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed anddistorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedlystirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from havingwalked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long agosurrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearingclothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn justone more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreamingperhaps of little more than an early spring.I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,surprisingly, begin to relax.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It's a firstperson piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, alot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeatingmyself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to getit out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fellduring the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.Happy holidays,Mark-O*  *  *     Christmas Day, Istanbul     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronouncedwords rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earthto die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,the story sounds strange and almost subversive.     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christianand Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent byGod, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed'sprophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistakenelevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing abig, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announcesthat we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and inEnglish, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyricsare basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?tocome?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorlytranslated chorus, which asks for the Son of God \"to come will be born inour heart?.     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to theservice.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I amsure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in thesanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first serviceof the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italianand a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, willoverflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consistmostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently somemembers of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, sincemany of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even beingforced to stand out in the cold.     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month ofRamadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one candiscern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during theninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solarcalendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started wellbefore dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who wasroaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummershave been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A traditionoriginating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is torustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal beforethe sun comes up.     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the yearfor Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which somesay influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Totalremission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I havebeen told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all theTurks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with whatI have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell methey fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling allsorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they aresignificantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, manyof the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful andeat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbinga simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning andeating them on my way to work.     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in theStates.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enoughCatholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really muchtoo strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little morethan an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local PresbyterianChurch (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with mytwin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often strugglefor the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemedsusceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to seeif any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light beingshown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeatthat light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinitedarkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given thatI am so far from what I am most familiar.     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I leanover toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids underhis breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,straighten back up, listen to the song begin.     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes awhile for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomesparticularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As ifsomething ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space thatenvelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  Iam moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel atear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the peoplehere are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to bereminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that isitself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the firsttime since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to takecommunion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that wewalk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there Iam surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonderwhere they might have been hiding.Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  Anolder woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder howshe can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at leastpretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about thechurch, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not wantto be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return tomy seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, soincongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view allthis, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other insuch an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions havecome up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live herewill be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhapsexchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shotsheard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, theIftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, wherespecial Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- atleast to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques andthe hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls toprayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleepunder the same black sky.\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" * * Translation from the Bible.\"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!The compassionate, the merciful!King on the day of reckoning!Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.Guide Thou us on the straight path,The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are notangry, and who go not astray.\" ** ** Translation from the Koran.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

He sent ittoo me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version Ihave isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind meis the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connectsthe Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbulin two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and theportion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com - 00_00051.JPG\n",

From the minarets of far away mosques, themuezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys andstreets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, amiserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the localmuezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds usthat God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important thansleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simplylisten, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back overme.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitchesitself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and Iargue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out ofreach.Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd theirway into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which meansthere's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before Idouse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself ofthe theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated withsleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fearI am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for somethingworth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages ofa quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when Ireally get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I reallydo have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my Englishlesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably madeany more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.                               *     *     *My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internetserver, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.

(I read that in Cairoyou could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastictarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, ingarbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfumeof car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of thebarnyard.And, today, the slaughter began.Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of theolder neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorouslychopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recentlyskinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animalin a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, nodoubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to imagesfrom Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's headunder a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking aboutstretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skinof a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a waterballoon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feedcontentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised tosee that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going onright next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaultedby a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put hisfingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car andwipe it on the license plate.The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, secondonly Ramadon (\"Ramazon\" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (\"hac\"in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means areto make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folksget at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During theholiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animalfor sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of itto others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateurbutcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an \"expert\"do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick andpainless as possible.The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and wasallowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about beliefand faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  Ican see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  Itcertainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story ofGod's sacrifice of his son.As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was aslaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Younggirls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran aroundthe streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  Ipassed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holdingher mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pileof discarded intestines.April 5, 1999My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bitsanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it'sonly that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bitmore discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at leasta  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including ripplingmuscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught andcleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our\"knowledge\" and \"experience\" comes secondhand through the media,including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If ourrituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves withdisintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close tototally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have everbeen.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeededonly in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul'schagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get achance to see just how long those legs are.Hope all is well.

AudenThe view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of redtiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other sideof the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalledand polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to becalled Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly sixcenturies before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear ofapartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlinesof towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman theMagnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered bythe before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but alreadyappearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, Isuppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far toolittle and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about therelevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybethousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip andrise in the air space between me and all of that.I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my windowwhile playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  Thisevening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by SteveEarle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long agolove (\"Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?\") and one by LucindaWilliams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (\"When I getto Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you\").  A pile of clouds staacked upon the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sunstill makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch theneddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappearsbehind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be headingin that same direction.What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've everdeveloped particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that isnot to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore SanFrancisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it wouldhave been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convincemyself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling downin one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of mylife is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all mightlead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'mjust looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I'vefound it.My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home afterwhat was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sureabout the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) Iaccosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but theytried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the firsttime I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on apost-dusk walk through the \"working class\" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on ourway to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the SuleymaniyeMosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularlypoorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in neartotal darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasionalflare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first notknowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passingnear a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely importantinstitution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have beentold) have no showers.Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha andNina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while sufferingthrough the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of mostsignificance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine monthsapart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  Duringone of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordynever-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building andlasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when Isuggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood spacebetween an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understanddepartment.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan onstudying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles andwriting and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb moredeeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, includingan incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this olddog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where tolay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is\"hearing\" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are \"Ne dediniz [What didyou say]?\" and \"Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?\".)  Iwill be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television isan important way to learn how to \"hear\" Turkish.Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writingprogram, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.(\"Insallah [With god's help].\")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and myreading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least Ishould be sending a few more e-mails.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "791: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeff,I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was acting under the direction of individuals running the program.The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of Simon's situation.In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time and energy on each individual case.  Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would like to discuss at your convenience.Thanks Charlene\n",

The muezzin's voice seems fuller,more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity inmy neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precautionagainst fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relativelyuntouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking thesquare surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partiallyblocking the road that circles the square.Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, thefirst a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began thismorning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building offits foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, itsroof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severedneatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildingsflattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steelreinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms offriends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves hermicrophone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trappedthere, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debrisabove.I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and Ihad spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under treeswhose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by SultanMahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over thecorrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke ofwriting, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, aboutlearning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter alongthe coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with theworst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our livesover, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in mybed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips thatare many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2am.It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm notsure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggeringdeeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in SanFrancisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it gotreally bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, andwhatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and soundsconfused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that therewere other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in myhallway, where three doorways were close together.The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells likewaves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all likethe comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my buildingbeing all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd newangles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imaginethat things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of therelatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soonthe shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then Ireally started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked withadrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, aflashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- andI had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even mycamera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was offby the time I opened my door a minute or two later.My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off toone side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it fora quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light hereand there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning acrossthe Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes ofa few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  Iworked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may havecollapsed.I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gatheredin the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though Ioccasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  Atone point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along IstiklalCaddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricitybeing out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidenceof the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, anabandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, inone hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (whichas I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, mostwere huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the womenwere wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? nextto the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people thereand, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty ofso miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may havecollapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were aseries of fairly significant aftershocks.On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has beenrescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appearsunscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking himquestions.  Were you scared?  \"Cok kokum [very scared]!\"  He seems pleasedto be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is askedabout his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  \"Annem [my mother],kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].Duydum!\"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  \"Sesleriduydum!  Sesleri duydum!\"Turkiye, iyi sanslar.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normalloads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxedby the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the sufferingwill be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lotof suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solidground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spenttwo of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and havebeen able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, everyopen space not too close to a building seems to be filled with peoplesleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between thingstrees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets maderelatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me howkind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of onepoor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindelymisplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And whatyou read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard byRussian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkeyall the luck in the world.  It will need it.Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot ofwhat they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.More later.

Turkey has a population ofsome 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The percapita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hitso hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the lastfew decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago towhat some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who movedfrom the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of thecorner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which todistribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try theAmerican Red Cross,  P.O.

      "807: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of thequake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (Ihad already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, includingpreparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  OnTuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hourstotal.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizingwhat I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for anewspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is ajournalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writingthe other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though Ialready knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I wenthome that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in themorning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add upto?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion inbetween.Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There areprobably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday'spaper(!).By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don'tget a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everythingwas all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting allright?More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (thoughIhipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20minutes and get ready for my class.Your little brother______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It's a firstperson piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, alot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeatingmyself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to getit out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fellduring the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.Happy holidays,Mark-O*  *  *     Christmas Day, Istanbul     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronouncedwords rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earthto die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,the story sounds strange and almost subversive.     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christianand Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent byGod, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed'sprophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistakenelevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing abig, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announcesthat we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and inEnglish, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyricsare basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?tocome?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorlytranslated chorus, which asks for the Son of God \"to come will be born inour heart?.     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to theservice.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I amsure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in thesanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first serviceof the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italianand a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, willoverflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consistmostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently somemembers of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, sincemany of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even beingforced to stand out in the cold.     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month ofRamadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one candiscern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during theninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solarcalendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started wellbefore dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who wasroaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummershave been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A traditionoriginating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is torustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal beforethe sun comes up.     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the yearfor Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which somesay influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Totalremission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I havebeen told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all theTurks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with whatI have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell methey fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling allsorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they aresignificantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, manyof the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful andeat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbinga simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning andeating them on my way to work.     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in theStates.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enoughCatholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really muchtoo strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little morethan an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local PresbyterianChurch (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with mytwin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often strugglefor the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemedsusceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to seeif any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light beingshown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeatthat light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinitedarkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given thatI am so far from what I am most familiar.     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I leanover toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids underhis breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,straighten back up, listen to the song begin.     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes awhile for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomesparticularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As ifsomething ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space thatenvelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  Iam moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel atear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the peoplehere are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to bereminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that isitself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the firsttime since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to takecommunion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that wewalk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there Iam surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonderwhere they might have been hiding.Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  Anolder woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder howshe can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at leastpretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about thechurch, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not wantto be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return tomy seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, soincongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view allthis, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other insuch an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions havecome up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live herewill be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhapsexchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shotsheard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, theIftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, wherespecial Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- atleast to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques andthe hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls toprayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleepunder the same black sky.\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" * * Translation from the Bible.\"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!The compassionate, the merciful!King on the day of reckoning!Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.Guide Thou us on the straight path,The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are notangry, and who go not astray.\" ** ** Translation from the Koran.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, butquickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some ofthe original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflectanything about yours truly.  Later.At The Galata Tower CafeCigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs inthe air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughtsabout teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.\"Take it easy\", it says with a smirk.  \"Relax.\"  A phony look of concernclouds it further.  \"What about taking a deep breath?\"  Surreptitiously(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has driftedin closer, notices.  \"There!  Isn't that better?\"\"No\", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to takethis internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through oneparticularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  \"Now get lost!\"Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way homefrom school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which isamplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone wallssurrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the hugetower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare outthe window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards ofthe tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  Thetower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entireneighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of thedurability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressivecharacteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, bythe slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), itstands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half asbothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubtbeen subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so yearhistory.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square tore-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm theonly one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have toserve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't botherthem, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's playhas a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basictraining.I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next tome. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, formy benefit, his version of the question \"More tea?\"  (He has given up onwords, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)\"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With alittle milk, please.]\"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, Iagree  [and have been told before] too many \"lutfens\".  There areprobably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.I'll work on perfecting them, \"sonra [later]\".) Yusuf nods, walks away.I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I musthave made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of thetables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is thebeginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitchedwail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poorthing, I look away.For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take aclose look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. \"Dikkat! [Watchout!]\")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which issurprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which areseriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle ofeach table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a cornerof the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scenefrom somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, ithas aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappearedamongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  Thegreen of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it isapproaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color ofthe mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the teaserved here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto thesand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as ifsomeone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed anddistorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedlystirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from havingwalked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long agosurrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearingclothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn justone more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreamingperhaps of little more than an early spring.I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,surprisingly, begin to relax.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

He sent ittoo me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version Ihave isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind meis the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connectsthe Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbulin two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and theportion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com - 00_00051.JPG\n",

From the minarets of far away mosques, themuezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys andstreets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, amiserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the localmuezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds usthat God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important thansleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simplylisten, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back overme.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitchesitself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and Iargue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out ofreach.Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd theirway into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which meansthere's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before Idouse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself ofthe theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated withsleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fearI am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for somethingworth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages ofa quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when Ireally get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I reallydo have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my Englishlesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably madeany more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.                               *     *     *My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internetserver, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.

(I read that in Cairoyou could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastictarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, ingarbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfumeof car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of thebarnyard.And, today, the slaughter began.Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of theolder neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorouslychopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recentlyskinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animalin a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, nodoubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to imagesfrom Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's headunder a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking aboutstretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skinof a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a waterballoon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feedcontentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised tosee that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going onright next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaultedby a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put hisfingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car andwipe it on the license plate.The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, secondonly Ramadon (\"Ramazon\" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj (\"hac\"in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means areto make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folksget at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During theholiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animalfor sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of itto others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateurbutcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an \"expert\"do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick andpainless as possible.The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and wasallowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about beliefand faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  Ican see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  Itcertainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story ofGod's sacrifice of his son.As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was aslaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Younggirls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran aroundthe streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  Ipassed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holdingher mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pileof discarded intestines.April 5, 1999My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bitsanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it'sonly that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bitmore discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at leasta  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including ripplingmuscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught andcleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our\"knowledge\" and \"experience\" comes secondhand through the media,including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If ourrituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves withdisintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close tototally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have everbeen.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeededonly in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul'schagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get achance to see just how long those legs are.Hope all is well.

AudenThe view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of redtiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other sideof the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalledand polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to becalled Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly sixcenturies before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear ofapartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlinesof towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman theMagnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered bythe before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but alreadyappearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, Isuppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far toolittle and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about therelevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybethousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip andrise in the air space between me and all of that.I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my windowwhile playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  Thisevening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by SteveEarle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long agolove (\"Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?\") and one by LucindaWilliams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget (\"When I getto Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you\").  A pile of clouds staacked upon the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sunstill makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch theneddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappearsbehind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be headingin that same direction.What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've everdeveloped particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that isnot to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore SanFrancisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it wouldhave been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convincemyself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling downin one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of mylife is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all mightlead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'mjust looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I'vefound it.My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home afterwhat was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sureabout the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) Iaccosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but theytried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the firsttime I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on apost-dusk walk through the \"working class\" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on ourway to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the SuleymaniyeMosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularlypoorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in neartotal darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasionalflare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first notknowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passingnear a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely importantinstitution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have beentold) have no showers.Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha andNina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while sufferingthrough the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of mostsignificance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine monthsapart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  Duringone of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordynever-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building andlasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when Isuggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood spacebetween an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understanddepartment.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan onstudying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles andwriting and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb moredeeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, includingan incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this olddog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where tolay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is\"hearing\" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are \"Ne dediniz [What didyou say]?\" and \"Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?\".)  Iwill be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television isan important way to learn how to \"hear\" Turkish.Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writingprogram, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.(\"Insallah [With god's help].\")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and myreading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least Ishould be sending a few more e-mails.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The muezzin's voice seems fuller,more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity inmy neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precautionagainst fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relativelyuntouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking thesquare surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partiallyblocking the road that circles the square.Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, thefirst a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began thismorning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building offits foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, itsroof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severedneatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildingsflattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steelreinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms offriends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves hermicrophone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trappedthere, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debrisabove.I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and Ihad spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under treeswhose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by SultanMahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over thecorrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke ofwriting, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, aboutlearning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter alongthe coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with theworst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our livesover, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in mybed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips thatare many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2am.It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm notsure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggeringdeeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in SanFrancisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it gotreally bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, andwhatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and soundsconfused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that therewere other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in myhallway, where three doorways were close together.The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells likewaves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all likethe comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my buildingbeing all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd newangles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imaginethat things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of therelatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soonthe shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then Ireally started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked withadrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, aflashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- andI had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even mycamera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was offby the time I opened my door a minute or two later.My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off toone side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it fora quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light hereand there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning acrossthe Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes ofa few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  Iworked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may havecollapsed.I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gatheredin the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though Ioccasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  Atone point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along IstiklalCaddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricitybeing out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidenceof the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, anabandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, inone hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (whichas I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, mostwere huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the womenwere wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? nextto the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people thereand, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty ofso miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may havecollapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were aseries of fairly significant aftershocks.On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has beenrescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appearsunscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking himquestions.  Were you scared?  \"Cok kokum [very scared]!\"  He seems pleasedto be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is askedabout his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  \"Annem [my mother],kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].Duydum!\"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  \"Sesleriduydum!  Sesleri duydum!\"Turkiye, iyi sanslar.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normalloads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxedby the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the sufferingwill be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lotof suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solidground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spenttwo of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and havebeen able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, everyopen space not too close to a building seems to be filled with peoplesleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between thingstrees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets maderelatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me howkind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of onepoor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindelymisplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And whatyou read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard byRussian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.

Turkey has a population ofsome 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The percapita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hitso hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the lastfew decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago towhat some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who movedfrom the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of thecorner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which todistribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try theAmerican Red Cross,  P.O.

      "846: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of thequake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (Ihad already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, includingpreparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  OnTuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hourstotal.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizingwhat I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for anewspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is ajournalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writingthe other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though Ialready knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I wenthome that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in themorning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add upto?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion inbetween.Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There areprobably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday'spaper(!).By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don'tget a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everythingwas all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting allright?More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (thoughIhipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20minutes and get ready for my class.Your little brother______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It's a firstperson piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, alot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeatingmyself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to getit out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fellduring the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.Happy holidays,Mark-O*  *  *     Christmas Day, Istanbul     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronouncedwords rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earthto die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,the story sounds strange and almost subversive.     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christianand Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent byGod, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed'sprophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistakenelevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing abig, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announcesthat we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and inEnglish, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyricsare basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?tocome?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorlytranslated chorus, which asks for the Son of God \"to come will be born inour heart?.     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to theservice.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I amsure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in thesanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first serviceof the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italianand a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, willoverflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consistmostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently somemembers of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, sincemany of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even beingforced to stand out in the cold.     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month ofRamadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one candiscern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during theninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solarcalendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started wellbefore dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who wasroaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummershave been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A traditionoriginating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is torustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal beforethe sun comes up.     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the yearfor Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which somesay influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Totalremission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I havebeen told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all theTurks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with whatI have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell methey fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling allsorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they aresignificantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, manyof the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful andeat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbinga simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning andeating them on my way to work.     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in theStates.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enoughCatholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really muchtoo strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little morethan an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local PresbyterianChurch (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with mytwin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often strugglefor the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemedsusceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to seeif any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light beingshown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeatthat light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinitedarkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given thatI am so far from what I am most familiar.     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I leanover toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids underhis breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,straighten back up, listen to the song begin.     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes awhile for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomesparticularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As ifsomething ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space thatenvelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  Iam moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel atear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the peoplehere are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to bereminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that isitself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the firsttime since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to takecommunion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that wewalk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there Iam surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonderwhere they might have been hiding.Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  Anolder woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder howshe can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at leastpretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about thechurch, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not wantto be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return tomy seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, soincongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view allthis, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other insuch an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions havecome up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live herewill be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhapsexchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shotsheard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, theIftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, wherespecial Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- atleast to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques andthe hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls toprayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleepunder the same black sky.\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" * * Translation from the Bible.\"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!The compassionate, the merciful!King on the day of reckoning!Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.Guide Thou us on the straight path,The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are notangry, and who go not astray.\" ** ** Translation from the Koran.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, butquickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some ofthe original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflectanything about yours truly.  Later.At The Galata Tower CafeCigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs inthe air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughtsabout teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.\"Take it easy\", it says with a smirk.  \"Relax.\"  A phony look of concernclouds it further.  \"What about taking a deep breath?\"  Surreptitiously(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has driftedin closer, notices.  \"There!  Isn't that better?\"\"No\", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to takethis internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through oneparticularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  \"Now get lost!\"Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way homefrom school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which isamplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone wallssurrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the hugetower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare outthe window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards ofthe tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  Thetower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entireneighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of thedurability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressivecharacteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, bythe slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), itstands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half asbothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubtbeen subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so yearhistory.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square tore-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm theonly one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have toserve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't botherthem, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's playhas a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basictraining.I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next tome. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, formy benefit, his version of the question \"More tea?\"  (He has given up onwords, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)\"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With alittle milk, please.]\"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, Iagree  [and have been told before] too many \"lutfens\".  There areprobably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.I'll work on perfecting them, \"sonra [later]\".) Yusuf nods, walks away.I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I musthave made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of thetables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is thebeginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitchedwail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poorthing, I look away.For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take aclose look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. \"Dikkat! [Watchout!]\")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which issurprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which areseriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle ofeach table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a cornerof the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scenefrom somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, ithas aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappearedamongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  Thegreen of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it isapproaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color ofthe mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the teaserved here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto thesand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as ifsomeone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed anddistorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedlystirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from havingwalked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long agosurrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearingclothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn justone more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreamingperhaps of little more than an early spring.I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,surprisingly, begin to relax.______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

He sent ittoo me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version Ihave isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind meis the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connectsthe Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbulin two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and theportion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.More later.Mark-O______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com - 00_00051.JPG\n",

He also did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number is 888 524 1326.Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a fax machine this weekend.

Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I love his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number is 888 524 1326.Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a fax machine this weekend. Let me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from down here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.I love you!Liz & Jose Luis\n",

Stores withoutelectricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lackof electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked aroundfor a couple hours, covering some ground.It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night andprobably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spontoutdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of thenight).

The bigpicture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach severalthousand, the injured over ten thousand.Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that istrue throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows anincredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  Theoriginal one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on thetube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of themback there.Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne byeveryone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available toall but those who died.

You're asking a lot of good questions.The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it'scontemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that thebuildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in thelowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineerof some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in ourtime.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of thediseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterionis that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see thingsup close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving alittle cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damagereally is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, thingsare pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, likeworsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye outfor trouble, though.More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.

Also important were your comments onwhat struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments arethe best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and whatdoesn't work.Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will bepublished by \"Tom Skilling's\" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), wouldnever had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all tofamiliar).Mark-O>From: <tskilling@tribune.com>>To: \"Mark Skilling\" <markskilling@hotmail.com>>Subject: IT'S FABULOUS!>Date: Wed, 25 Aug 1999 13:25:22 -0500>>>      Mark-->           My read on this is that it's terrific.

(It's fair to say that this struggle is one of the>main reasons I first became interested in Turkey.)

This river, once beautiful and fast flowing,>is now stalled and polluted.  On the other side of the Golden Horn are the>hills where the ancient city Byzantium -- later to be called>Constantinople,>later still Istanbul -- was founded some 2 1/2 thousand years ago.  Above a>cement colored smear of apartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I>can make out the outlines of towers that were part of defensive walls first>started in the sixth century, nearly 1 1/2 thousand years ago.  They are>now>rotten with age, though parts had recently been rebuilt for tourists.  Some>of these restored parts collapsed during last Tuesday's earthquake.  The>ancient parts were left untouched.>>Less than a block away is the minaret of our small, neighborhood mosque.>From here you can hear, five times a day, its \"ezan\" or call to prayer.>That call is now as if a lament.  The muezzin's voice seems fuller, more>emotional than usual.  He sings in Arabic, which I don't understand, but>I've read that his call reminds the believers that \"God is most great\" and>tells them to \"Come to prayer, come to prosperity.\"  I listen carefully,>for>signs of doubt about God's mercy and compassion.  But I detect no doubt at>all.  Instead, it is simply beautiful and sad, and despite not>understanding>what he sings, very moving.>>In the past few days I have heard many sad, tired people say automatically,>and surprisingly without bitterness, that \"Allah verir, Allah alir [God>gives, God takes away].\"  And much has been taken away.  The death toll>from>last Tuesday's earthquake is likely to exceed 40,000, with an equal number>injured.  Up to 200,000 have been left homeless.  Millions more in the days>immediately following the quake chose to sleep outdoors, including me,>afraid of the aftershocks.  All over Istanbul, in the parks and squares,>even on narrow medians between busy streets, entire families spent the days>and nights on blankets spread out on the ground.  In the grassy Hippodrome>along side the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that same>mosque and the Sancta Sophia -- where you would normally expect hundreds of>tourists to be milling about -- it was as if a great migration was taking>place.  Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves.  Other women,>despite the heat, were dressed from head to toe in more somber black.  Some>families brought portable propane burners to make the their beloved tea.>Many more had lugged along pillows and mattresses, others string and rope>which they strung between trees and posts and hung sheets for a bit of>privacy.>>On the nights immediately after the quake, I was grateful to receive an>invitation to join my friend Ismail's family, and the family of a friend of>his, to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus>Bridge.  The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge, modern suspension bridge>connecting>Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in>San Francisco.  With the bridge's hulk looming seemingly helplessly below>us, I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground.>We>drank tea, smoked cigarettes and joked about being \"gocebe [nomads]\", and>about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots.  I>practiced my Turkish with the children, who, unlike most older Turks, were>able to correct me in English.  During the night, while I slept, someone>put>a jacket over me.>>Now that the rains and cooler weather have come, and the experts have given>an all-clear sign, most of us have returned to our homes.  Back in my>apartment, I glance at my walls, at my ceilings, find it impossible not to>think of all those still buried underneath theirs.  Last night, at our>favorite tea garden, I joined Ismail and his wife, Dilek, who had just>learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari.  We talked about>whether people here will ever be able to forget, return to something of a>normal life.  It hadn't started raining yet, so we stayed late, admitted to>being a bit nervous about returning home.>>The government and the army are being severely criticized in the local>press>and on the streets, as are the construction contractors.  There have been>other problems as well.  In an open area near the caf? I mentioned above,>where dozens of families had come to spend the night, an old man had his>shoes stolen.  I was told the story of a Turk in Yalova, one of the hardest>hit areas, selling bottled water for 1.5 million TL ($4 dollars), ten times>the normal price.  (That profiteer, however, was apparently beaten>subsequently by the storyteller himself, while a nearby policeman did>nothing to intervene.)>>Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the>official response, that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and>impressive.  A large truck from my relatively poor, working class>neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies -- water, bread,>medicine -- and sent to one disaster site.  The company of one of my>student's sent along a similar truckload of supplies, and has now set up a>fund to collect money for the homeless.  The same is true of business group>to which the company of a dear friend of mine, Sukran, belongs.  Efforts>like these have been going on everywhere. In addition, thousands of people>from all over Turkey have gone to the stricken areas to help, including>Kurds who want to prove their commitment to the Turkish State.>>I recall the criticism I heard after the 1989 San Francisco \"World Series\">Earthquake, which I unfortunately experienced as well.  Though admittedly a>much less serious affair, the cries about lax enforcement of building codes>were similar.  Everyone promised to do better, and I hope they have.  I>recall my own pathetic plans, never implemented, to prepare for the next>\"big one\".  I had cut an article out of the paper, which listed the>emergency supplies that should be kept close on hand.  Though I kept that>list near to the top of my pile of important papers, over the years it>simply grew yellow and torn.  I finally threw it away at the time I packed>up for my move to Istanbul.  Significantly, before I left San Francisco>last>fall, damage from that quake was still being repaired, some ten years>later,>and complaints could still be heard about the government's continuing>failure to enforce building codes rigorously enough.>>My experience since coming to Istanbul has been one of almost unending>Turkish hospitality.  I could have been left alone, but was not.  When I>first came here, on vacation, some two years ago, I meet a fine man, Ilyas,>who makes Saz (a stringed musical instrument that is as important here as>the guitar is in America) and bought a beautiful one from him.  When I>returned to Istanbul, this time to live, I visited Ilyas again, to say>hello>and talk about possible Saz lessons.  When he learned I was looking for an>apartment, he took most of the next day off and showed me around his>neighborhood, eventually helping me to find the place I now live.  The>lessons he eventually gave me were free.  My friend Ismail has spent>countless hours with me, roaming the city, looking for deals on used>furniture.  He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug, a blanket,>and several other very useful items in my apartment.  I occasionally get>gifts from my students, and never an unkind word from anyone.  After the>earthquake itself, several of my Turkish friends kept in constant touch>with>me.>>Several days ago, on the television, I saw and heard a crowd burst into>applause.  A young boy had just been rescued from one of the many collapsed>buildings.  Except for being dusty, he appeared unscathed.  As they carried>him to an ambulance a reporter followed, asking him questions.  Were you>scared?  \"Cok korktum [very scared]!\"  He response was perky.  He was>clearly delighted to be back in the world, by the attention he was getting.>Then he was asked about his family.  His eyes grew wide, his face long.>\"Annem [my mother], kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard>their voices].  Duydum!\"  By the time they reached the ambulance, he was>screaming.  \"Sesleri duydum!  Sesleri duydum!\">>I hope the rest of the world hears Turkey's cries for help.  \"Insallah,>daha>iyi olacak [With God's help, things will be better].\"  Insallah.  Turkiye,>iyi sanslar.  From all of us, good luck.>>August 25, 1999>Istanbul, Turkey>>>>______________________________________________________>Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com>>______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "764: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,You don't know how nice it is receiving your e-mails, and to hear howexcited you are.  There's no Hemingway in the making here, but I see youknow that he got his start as a journalist.  Did you also know his firstserious work was covering the the two Balkan wars (1912-14) in the city ofErdine (the Greek, and more famous, name is Adrianople), which is just westof here on what is now the border of Turkey and Greece.  (I visited Erdineseveral months ago; its another messy, beautiful Turkish town.)   Somehistorians consider these wars to really be part of World War I.  And Iguess he witnessed part of the huge cross-migrations of Turks and Greeks,when at the foundation of the Turkish Republic (1923) hundreds of thousandsof Greeks left Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks left Greece.  (Bothcounties were previously part of the more tolerant Ottoman Empire, theexistence of which was destroyed by the rise of nationalism in the last twocenturies.)  This migration, a tragedy of epic proportions (know now simplyas the \"Mubadele [The Exchange]\" in Turkish) was probably one of the firstexamples of large scale ethnic cleansing.About having gone through a lot, not true.  Today is beautiful day here inIstanbul, pleasantly cool (after an awfully hot and humid summer), the aircleared by a nightime rain.  It was tough to imagine the pain and hardshipgoing on just several miles west and east of here, to which now is added mudand cold.  This morning I taught my students (at the Istanbul branch officeof a German company that makes silicon and silicon products) the Englishexpression \"Every dark cloud has a silver lining\"  I feel I've lived mylife, when not under perfectly clear skies, in the silver linings.More later.

      "766: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeffrey,Just a quicknote to say hello.  Looking forward to the prophesizedletter.You'll be interested to know that a couple weeks ago, when I was on myway to Greece to renew my visa, passed Enron's progject at MarmaraEregilisi, a town on the Maramara Sea, which is the same body of waterthat has the island where Abdullah Ocalan (\"Apo\", the Kurdish terrorist)is beng held.  Had read about the project in a Turkish newspaper(English translation; not ready to read real Turkish newpapers yet)earlier.  Also read an article about a study Enron did for the USgovernment about the natural gas pipeline from Baku through Geogia tothe Black Sea coast.  You guys are everywhere.I also read that The Economist is sponsoring some sort of energyconference in Ankara (which is suppose to be a gloomy sort of place;especially this time of year) in the next few weeks.  Are you going?Least you think all I do is read about Enron, been having the time of mylife here, which is not to say things have been easy.  But I'm stillwhere things like standing in four different lines at the port office topick up a pakage is charming.  (Besides Asia Minor being the birth placeof agriculture, democarcy and Christianity [all, albeit, in the distantpast], it was also the birthplace of buracracy [as you probably know,the word byzantine comes from Byzantium, the name for Istanbul before itbecame Constantinople].)Hope all is well.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

Do they get letters about articles and, if so, doyou think I will get to see them (not just the ones they publish, assumingthey publish any)?  Can't wait to see what mom sends.  Tell her thanks aheadof time.  I was able to pull a copy off the Internet, and it was enjoyableto see my name in print, esepcially in such an important newspaper.  Thanksagain.Interesting that in same section another article about Itstanbul was run,and that in my article I mentioned the Hagia Sophia, the subject of thatother article.Have felt an aftershock or two in the last week, but not the relatively bigone that killed a man.  And what I've felt nothing more than a little wiggleof the earth.  (If you recall, on the morning of the big one I went back tosleep, during which I felt lots of them (though again all not much more thanas if a truck went by the building).Hope all goes well and you are not working too too hard (I know you'reworkng too hard).

      "770: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfMom,Your letter was wonderful.  I was \"transported\" to Illinois and the condo,and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and mycorrespondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemedas excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was,especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing thise-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or lesssimultaneously.I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see(generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on thefirst page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a fingerof water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directlyabove the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossingthe Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the GalataBridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page isthe blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in aneighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).  I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its alsoamazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that.It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time iscruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bellfor me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (althoughIstanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York Ithink).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I didbag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent anexcellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, asno centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought agas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's aleak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets againstthe freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g.alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready(clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few morethings while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any otherway.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life notinaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I,despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.  I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most thingsare a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- evenCrest -- is here in spades.)Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?More later, and a lot of that in person.  Thanks again for the note andsending along the article.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "778: Jeffrey,Wow.  What can I say.  Will it help?  It covers about thirty months ofrent here (and I have a nice place), and makes it nearly certain that Ihave the wherewithall to hang in there long enough to give this writingthing an umitigated shot.  Thanks so very much.Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciatinggetting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had alot of great days here).  Have met a \"harika [wonderful]\" Turkish woman,and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and foundyour letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced \"Shoo-kron\").  More abouther later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened yourletter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlesslyfacinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead oftime as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting colorfor me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time ofmy life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though itmay be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and Iactually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studiedTurkish and prepared my next English lessons.I recently sent Kristin an \"introduction to Istanbul\" e-mail (we justgot in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her torun off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).Hope you're enjoying your work.  Let me know what else is happening inyour life.  Thanks again for everything.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "779: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfGreat to hear from you!  I got both messages.How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the laststraw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It wouldbe great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and ifyou could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman veryinformal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would begood for his English.Thinking of you \"up north\" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still sockedin, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul'ssprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees fromthe Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site ofPKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit ofimprovising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and makelives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from thecountryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a fewfolks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competingdifferences.All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live forthe reader.  But there's just so much \"stuff\" that makes up any givenpiece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around abit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to singlehandedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.More later.  Good luck with all you do.Love,MarkGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

Enjoyed the pictures of Tom.Mom, you're right about a place to live.  Have a good one here.  A bitraw by US standards, but perfect for me.  Older building in interesting,\"real\" neighborhood; aesthetically pleasing apartment, with wood floors,ok molding, and super excellent, quintessential Istanbul view.  Thereare twelve apartments in the building, most of which are rented byMoslem families (veils and all).  A couple are used for storage by localbusinesses and one is rented by an English journalist.  Will get somepictures to you someday soon (though not taking many photos so far, aswant to experience this place as much in my brain, where the words are,as is possible).  Took a while to get my place reasonably comfortable,as had to buy furniture, etc, but that actually a lot of fun, in a way.Part of the experience, and I learned a lot.  Even had to install my ownlight fixtures.  No central-heating, so use one natural gas and oneelectric heater.  Ismail was/is very helpful in all ways, both withtechnical support and with help finding bargains.  I've been very lucky.Not \"running\" around too much.  Indeed, literally can't run.  Otherwise,my new hips performing flawlessly and thrilled at the absence of painand how strong they are.  Hoping to find an affordable pool around here,but such things not high on Turkey's needed infrastructure list.  Exceptfor super expensive pools in the luxury hotels ($25/day), very few poolsin Istanbul.  (Sorry Dad, no golf courses either.)Haven't worked too hard on trying to paint the \"big picture\" in mylittle blurbs.  But generally, go to Turkish classes three mornings aweek, starting at nine o'clock, for four hours each day.  Study a leastthat much on my own, not including trying to have \"real life\" Turkishlessons.  Work about 15 hours a week, not including preparation andtravelling time, which almost doubles that figure.  (Since each worksession usually only two hours, spend an inordinate amount of time onunpaid travelling; so far that's ok, as I enjoy the travelling, becauseI get to see odd parts of Istanbul.  That bit of charm will probablywear off over time.)  Have enjoyed figuring out the transit system, andhave gotten pretty good at using the buses, metro, the dolmas (somethingin between buses and taxis).  Cook at home a few times a week -- pasta,rice and veggies; things like that (there are tiny bakeries andvegitable stands everywhere)  -- though eating out here can be reallycheap and interesting.  Have two really good Turk friends now; Ismailand a wonderful women named Sukran (pronounced \"Shookrahn\").  Spend verylittle time with yabanci (foreigners, like me).  We spend a fair amountof time in cafes (which are bountiful and central to life her) talkingabout writing, politics, Turkish, etc.  At least once a week I go on along walk through a part of the city I haven't seen yet.

A bit ironic.Took a long walk around this morning, crossing the Galata Bridge into OldIstanbul (my neighborhood can't be called young) and saw little evidence ofdamage.  Suspect most of it in new construction areas out on the edge ofthis huge metropolitan area, where conrers get cut.

The bigpicture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach severalthousand, the injured over ten thousand.Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that istrue throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows anincredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  Theoriginal one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on thetube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of themback there.Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne byeveryone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available toall but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something thisbig in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in someserious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soonand send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, itwas great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about mylife here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.

Unfortunately will have to spend quite a bit of time I'm afraidfinding new tenant, as the old one (who's been great) is moving out after ayear.  Wish me luck.Keeping pretty well informed here.  Don't expect things to get too bad, atleast in the sense that I'll be suffering any serious deprevations.  This isa big, cosmopolitan city (perhaps, in some ways, the most cosmopolitan cityin the world), which in many ways is quite modern (in its own, primitiveway).  Its got plenty of McDonalds, for instance, at which I can (Allahforbid) stiffle any hunger pangs.  My friends Ismail and Sukran are lookingout for me as well, and for example talked me into staying out doors for twoof the three nights following the quake.Its raining now and has cooled down considerably, which is great for me buta very mixed blessing for those trying to get things somewhat back togethereast and west of here.  Wish them luck. God, what a horrible thing.  Justhorrible.  I feel guilty that things in my life so normal.  And thingsreally are, for all practical purposes, back to normal.

      "803: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it'scontemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that thebuildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in thelowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineerof some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in ourtime.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of thediseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterionis that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see thingsup close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving alittle cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damagereally is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, thingsare pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, likeworsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye outfor trouble, though.More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.

Also important were your comments onwhat struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments arethe best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and whatdoesn't work.Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will bepublished by \"Tom Skilling's\" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), wouldnever had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all tofamiliar).Mark-O>From: <tskilling@tribune.com>>To: \"Mark Skilling\" <markskilling@hotmail.com>>Subject: IT'S FABULOUS!>Date: Wed, 25 Aug 1999 13:25:22 -0500>>>      Mark-->           My read on this is that it's terrific.

Millions more in the days>immediately following the quake chose to sleep outdoors, including me,>afraid of the aftershocks.  All over Istanbul, in the parks and squares,>even on narrow medians between busy streets, entire families spent the days>and nights on blankets spread out on the ground.  In the grassy Hippodrome>along side the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that same>mosque and the Sancta Sophia -- where you would normally expect hundreds of>tourists to be milling about -- it was as if a great migration was taking>place.  Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves.  Other women,>despite the heat, were dressed from head to toe in more somber black.  Some>families brought portable propane burners to make the their beloved tea.>Many more had lugged along pillows and mattresses, others string and rope>which they strung between trees and posts and hung sheets for a bit of>privacy.>>On the nights immediately after the quake, I was grateful to receive an>invitation to join my friend Ismail's family, and the family of a friend of>his, to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus>Bridge.  The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge, modern suspension bridge>connecting>Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in>San Francisco.  With the bridge's hulk looming seemingly helplessly below>us, I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground.>We>drank tea, smoked cigarettes and joked about being \"gocebe [nomads]\", and>about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots.  I>practiced my Turkish with the children, who, unlike most older Turks, were>able to correct me in English.  During the night, while I slept, someone>put>a jacket over me.>>Now that the rains and cooler weather have come, and the experts have given>an all-clear sign, most of us have returned to our homes.  Back in my>apartment, I glance at my walls, at my ceilings, find it impossible not to>think of all those still buried underneath theirs.  Last night, at our>favorite tea garden, I joined Ismail and his wife, Dilek, who had just>learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari.

It hadn't started raining yet, so we stayed late, admitted to>being a bit nervous about returning home.>>The government and the army are being severely criticized in the local>press>and on the streets, as are the construction contractors.  There have been>other problems as well.  In an open area near the caf? I mentioned above,>where dozens of families had come to spend the night, an old man had his>shoes stolen.

(That profiteer, however, was apparently beaten>subsequently by the storyteller himself, while a nearby policeman did>nothing to intervene.)>>Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the>official response, that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and>impressive.

I could have been left alone, but was not.

When I>returned to Istanbul, this time to live, I visited Ilyas again, to say>hello>and talk about possible Saz lessons.  When he learned I was looking for an>apartment, he took most of the next day off and showed me around his>neighborhood, eventually helping me to find the place I now live.  The>lessons he eventually gave me were free.  My friend Ismail has spent>countless hours with me, roaming the city, looking for deals on used>furniture.  He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug, a blanket,>and several other very useful items in my apartment.  I occasionally get>gifts from my students, and never an unkind word from anyone.

      "805: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,You don't know how nice it is receiving your e-mails, and to hear howexcited you are.  There's no Hemingway in the making here, but I see youknow that he got his start as a journalist.  Did you also know his firstserious work was covering the the two Balkan wars (1912-14) in the city ofErdine (the Greek, and more famous, name is Adrianople), which is just westof here on what is now the border of Turkey and Greece.  (I visited Erdineseveral months ago; its another messy, beautiful Turkish town.)   Somehistorians consider these wars to really be part of World War I.  And Iguess he witnessed part of the huge cross-migrations of Turks and Greeks,when at the foundation of the Turkish Republic (1923) hundreds of thousandsof Greeks left Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks left Greece.  (Bothcounties were previously part of the more tolerant Ottoman Empire, theexistence of which was destroyed by the rise of nationalism in the last twocenturies.)  This migration, a tragedy of epic proportions (know now simplyas the \"Mubadele [The Exchange]\" in Turkish) was probably one of the firstexamples of large scale ethnic cleansing.About having gone through a lot, not true.  Today is beautiful day here inIstanbul, pleasantly cool (after an awfully hot and humid summer), the aircleared by a nightime rain.  It was tough to imagine the pain and hardshipgoing on just several miles west and east of here, to which now is added mudand cold.  This morning I taught my students (at the Istanbul branch officeof a German company that makes silicon and silicon products) the Englishexpression \"Every dark cloud has a silver lining\"  I feel I've lived mylife, when not under perfectly clear skies, in the silver linings.More later.

      "810: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfMom,Your letter was wonderful.  I was \"transported\" to Illinois and the condo,and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and mycorrespondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemedas excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was,especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing thise-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or lesssimultaneously.I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see(generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on thefirst page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a fingerof water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directlyabove the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossingthe Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the GalataBridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page isthe blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in aneighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).  I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its alsoamazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that.It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time iscruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bellfor me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (althoughIstanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York Ithink).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I didbag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent anexcellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, asno centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought agas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's aleak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets againstthe freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g.alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready(clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few morethings while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any otherway.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life notinaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I,despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.  I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most thingsare a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- evenCrest -- is here in spades.)Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?More later, and a lot of that in person.

      "814: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeffrey,Just a quicknote to say hello.  Looking forward to the prophesizedletter.You'll be interested to know that a couple weeks ago, when I was on myway to Greece to renew my visa, passed Enron's progject at MarmaraEregilisi, a town on the Maramara Sea, which is the same body of waterthat has the island where Abdullah Ocalan (\"Apo\", the Kurdish terrorist)is beng held.  Had read about the project in a Turkish newspaper(English translation; not ready to read real Turkish newpapers yet)earlier.  Also read an article about a study Enron did for the USgovernment about the natural gas pipeline from Baku through Geogia tothe Black Sea coast.  You guys are everywhere.I also read that The Economist is sponsoring some sort of energyconference in Ankara (which is suppose to be a gloomy sort of place;especially this time of year) in the next few weeks.  Are you going?Least you think all I do is read about Enron, been having the time of mylife here, which is not to say things have been easy.  But I'm stillwhere things like standing in four different lines at the port office topick up a pakage is charming.  (Besides Asia Minor being the birth placeof agriculture, democarcy and Christianity [all, albeit, in the distantpast], it was also the birthplace of buracracy [as you probably know,the word byzantine comes from Byzantium, the name for Istanbul before itbecame Constantinople].)Hope all is well.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

It covers about thirty months ofrent here (and I have a nice place), and makes it nearly certain that Ihave the wherewithall to hang in there long enough to give this writingthing an umitigated shot.  Thanks so very much.Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciatinggetting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had alot of great days here).  Have met a \"harika [wonderful]\" Turkish woman,and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and foundyour letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced \"Shoo-kron\").  More abouther later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened yourletter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlesslyfacinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead oftime as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting colorfor me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time ofmy life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though itmay be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and Iactually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studiedTurkish and prepared my next English lessons.I recently sent Kristin an \"introduction to Istanbul\" e-mail (we justgot in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her torun off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).Hope you're enjoying your work.

      "820: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfGreat to hear from you!  I got both messages.How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the laststraw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It wouldbe great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and ifyou could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman veryinformal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would begood for his English.Thinking of you \"up north\" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still sockedin, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul'ssprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees fromthe Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site ofPKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit ofimprovising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and makelives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from thecountryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a fewfolks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competingdifferences.All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live forthe reader.  But there's just so much \"stuff\" that makes up any givenpiece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around abit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to singlehandedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.More later.

      "833: X-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,Reading thourgh my mail and came to your newest note.  Thanks again for thecommunication.Like I said in earlier note, things seem pretty normal.  Stores withoutelectricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lackof electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked aroundfor a couple hours, covering some ground.It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night andprobably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spontoutdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of thenight).  The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here thestars were all out, as the city had gone dark.

The bigpicture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach severalthousand, the injured over ten thousand.Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that istrue throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows anincredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  Theoriginal one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on thetube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of themback there.Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne byeveryone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available toall but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something thisbig in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in someserious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soonand send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, itwas great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about mylife here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.

Unfortunately will have to spend quite a bit of time I'm afraidfinding new tenant, as the old one (who's been great) is moving out after ayear.  Wish me luck.Keeping pretty well informed here.  Don't expect things to get too bad, atleast in the sense that I'll be suffering any serious deprevations.  This isa big, cosmopolitan city (perhaps, in some ways, the most cosmopolitan cityin the world), which in many ways is quite modern (in its own, primitiveway).  Its got plenty of McDonalds, for instance, at which I can (Allahforbid) stiffle any hunger pangs.  My friends Ismail and Sukran are lookingout for me as well, and for example talked me into staying out doors for twoof the three nights following the quake.Its raining now and has cooled down considerably, which is great for me buta very mixed blessing for those trying to get things somewhat back togethereast and west of here.  Wish them luck. God, what a horrible thing.  Justhorrible.  I feel guilty that things in my life so normal.  And thingsreally are, for all practical purposes, back to normal.

      "841: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it'scontemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that thebuildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in thelowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineerof some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in ourtime.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of thediseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterionis that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see thingsup close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving alittle cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damagereally is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, thingsare pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, likeworsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye outfor trouble, though.More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.

Also important were your comments onwhat struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments arethe best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and whatdoesn't work.Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will bepublished by \"Tom Skilling's\" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), wouldnever had gotten close to this opportunity without you.

Millions more in the days>immediately following the quake chose to sleep outdoors, including me,>afraid of the aftershocks.  All over Istanbul, in the parks and squares,>even on narrow medians between busy streets, entire families spent the days>and nights on blankets spread out on the ground.  In the grassy Hippodrome>along side the spectacular Blue Mosque and in the gardens between that same>mosque and the Sancta Sophia -- where you would normally expect hundreds of>tourists to be milling about -- it was as if a great migration was taking>place.  Many of the women wore brightly colored headscarves.  Other women,>despite the heat, were dressed from head to toe in more somber black.  Some>families brought portable propane burners to make the their beloved tea.>Many more had lugged along pillows and mattresses, others string and rope>which they strung between trees and posts and hung sheets for a bit of>privacy.>>On the nights immediately after the quake, I was grateful to receive an>invitation to join my friend Ismail's family, and the family of a friend of>his, to spend the night in a little park in the hills above the Bosphorus>Bridge.  The Bosphorus Bridge is a huge, modern suspension bridge>connecting>Europe and Asia that looks like a gray version of the Golden Gate Bridge in>San Francisco.  With the bridge's hulk looming seemingly helplessly below>us, I shared a corner of a colorful Turkish blanket covering the ground.>We>drank tea, smoked cigarettes and joked about being \"gocebe [nomads]\", and>about the Turks finally returning to their forgotten nomadic roots.  I>practiced my Turkish with the children, who, unlike most older Turks, were>able to correct me in English.  During the night, while I slept, someone>put>a jacket over me.>>Now that the rains and cooler weather have come, and the experts have given>an all-clear sign, most of us have returned to our homes.  Back in my>apartment, I glance at my walls, at my ceilings, find it impossible not to>think of all those still buried underneath theirs.  Last night, at our>favorite tea garden, I joined Ismail and his wife, Dilek, who had just>learned that three of her cousins had died in Adapazari.  We talked about>whether people here will ever be able to forget, return to something of a>normal life.  It hadn't started raining yet, so we stayed late, admitted to>being a bit nervous about returning home.>>The government and the army are being severely criticized in the local>press>and on the streets, as are the construction contractors.  There have been>other problems as well.  In an open area near the caf? I mentioned above,>where dozens of families had come to spend the night, an old man had his>shoes stolen.  I was told the story of a Turk in Yalova, one of the hardest>hit areas, selling bottled water for 1.5 million TL ($4 dollars), ten times>the normal price.  (That profiteer, however, was apparently beaten>subsequently by the storyteller himself, while a nearby policeman did>nothing to intervene.)>>Yet notwithstanding the widespread and no doubt legitimate anger at the>official response, that of ordinary Turks has been overwhelming and>impressive.  A large truck from my relatively poor, working class>neighborhood was quickly filled with needed supplies -- water, bread,>medicine -- and sent to one disaster site.  The company of one of my>student's sent along a similar truckload of supplies, and has now set up a>fund to collect money for the homeless.  The same is true of business group>to which the company of a dear friend of mine, Sukran, belongs.  Efforts>like these have been going on everywhere. In addition, thousands of people>from all over Turkey have gone to the stricken areas to help, including>Kurds who want to prove their commitment to the Turkish State.>>I recall the criticism I heard after the 1989 San Francisco \"World Series\">Earthquake, which I unfortunately experienced as well.  Though admittedly a>much less serious affair, the cries about lax enforcement of building codes>were similar.  Everyone promised to do better, and I hope they have.  I>recall my own pathetic plans, never implemented, to prepare for the next>\"big one\".  I had cut an article out of the paper, which listed the>emergency supplies that should be kept close on hand.  Though I kept that>list near to the top of my pile of important papers, over the years it>simply grew yellow and torn.  I finally threw it away at the time I packed>up for my move to Istanbul.  Significantly, before I left San Francisco>last>fall, damage from that quake was still being repaired, some ten years>later,>and complaints could still be heard about the government's continuing>failure to enforce building codes rigorously enough.>>My experience since coming to Istanbul has been one of almost unending>Turkish hospitality.  I could have been left alone, but was not.  When I>first came here, on vacation, some two years ago, I meet a fine man, Ilyas,>who makes Saz (a stringed musical instrument that is as important here as>the guitar is in America) and bought a beautiful one from him.  When I>returned to Istanbul, this time to live, I visited Ilyas again, to say>hello>and talk about possible Saz lessons.  When he learned I was looking for an>apartment, he took most of the next day off and showed me around his>neighborhood, eventually helping me to find the place I now live.  The>lessons he eventually gave me were free.  My friend Ismail has spent>countless hours with me, roaming the city, looking for deals on used>furniture.  He and his wife have also lent me a beautiful rug, a blanket,>and several other very useful items in my apartment.  I occasionally get>gifts from my students, and never an unkind word from anyone.  After the>earthquake itself, several of my Turkish friends kept in constant touch>with>me.>>Several days ago, on the television, I saw and heard a crowd burst into>applause.  A young boy had just been rescued from one of the many collapsed>buildings.  Except for being dusty, he appeared unscathed.  As they carried>him to an ambulance a reporter followed, asking him questions.  Were you>scared?  \"Cok korktum [very scared]!\"  He response was perky.  He was>clearly delighted to be back in the world, by the attention he was getting.>Then he was asked about his family.

      "843: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfTom,You don't know how nice it is receiving your e-mails, and to hear howexcited you are.  There's no Hemingway in the making here, but I see youknow that he got his start as a journalist.  Did you also know his firstserious work was covering the the two Balkan wars (1912-14) in the city ofErdine (the Greek, and more famous, name is Adrianople), which is just westof here on what is now the border of Turkey and Greece.  (I visited Erdineseveral months ago; its another messy, beautiful Turkish town.)   Somehistorians consider these wars to really be part of World War I.  And Iguess he witnessed part of the huge cross-migrations of Turks and Greeks,when at the foundation of the Turkish Republic (1923) hundreds of thousandsof Greeks left Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks left Greece.  (Bothcounties were previously part of the more tolerant Ottoman Empire, theexistence of which was destroyed by the rise of nationalism in the last twocenturies.)  This migration, a tragedy of epic proportions (know now simplyas the \"Mubadele [The Exchange]\" in Turkish) was probably one of the firstexamples of large scale ethnic cleansing.About having gone through a lot, not true.  Today is beautiful day here inIstanbul, pleasantly cool (after an awfully hot and humid summer), the aircleared by a nightime rain.  It was tough to imagine the pain and hardshipgoing on just several miles west and east of here, to which now is added mudand cold.  This morning I taught my students (at the Istanbul branch officeof a German company that makes silicon and silicon products) the Englishexpression \"Every dark cloud has a silver lining\"  I feel I've lived mylife, when not under perfectly clear skies, in the silver linings.More later.

      "845: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfJeffrey,Just a quicknote to say hello.  Looking forward to the prophesizedletter.You'll be interested to know that a couple weeks ago, when I was on myway to Greece to renew my visa, passed Enron's progject at MarmaraEregilisi, a town on the Maramara Sea, which is the same body of waterthat has the island where Abdullah Ocalan (\"Apo\", the Kurdish terrorist)is beng held.  Had read about the project in a Turkish newspaper(English translation; not ready to read real Turkish newpapers yet)earlier.  Also read an article about a study Enron did for the USgovernment about the natural gas pipeline from Baku through Geogia tothe Black Sea coast.  You guys are everywhere.I also read that The Economist is sponsoring some sort of energyconference in Ankara (which is suppose to be a gloomy sort of place;especially this time of year) in the next few weeks.  Are you going?Least you think all I do is read about Enron, been having the time of mylife here, which is not to say things have been easy.  But I'm stillwhere things like standing in four different lines at the port office topick up a pakage is charming.  (Besides Asia Minor being the birth placeof agriculture, democarcy and Christianity [all, albeit, in the distantpast], it was also the birthplace of buracracy [as you probably know,the word byzantine comes from Byzantium, the name for Istanbul before itbecame Constantinople].)Hope all is well.Love,Mark______________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

      "849: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfMom,Your letter was wonderful.  I was \"transported\" to Illinois and the condo,and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and mycorrespondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemedas excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was,especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing thise-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or lesssimultaneously.I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see(generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on thefirst page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a fingerof water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directlyabove the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossingthe Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the GalataBridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page isthe blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in aneighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).  I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its alsoamazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that.It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time iscruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bellfor me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (althoughIstanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York Ithink).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I didbag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent anexcellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, asno centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought agas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's aleak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets againstthe freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g.alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready(clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few morethings while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any otherway.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life notinaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I,despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.  I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most thingsare a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- evenCrest -- is here in spades.)Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?More later, and a lot of that in person.

Thanks so very much.Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciatinggetting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had alot of great days here).  Have met a \"harika [wonderful]\" Turkish woman,and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and foundyour letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced \"Shoo-kron\").  More abouther later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened yourletter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlesslyfacinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead oftime as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting colorfor me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time ofmy life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though itmay be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and Iactually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studiedTurkish and prepared my next English lessons.I recently sent Kristin an \"introduction to Istanbul\" e-mail (we justgot in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her torun off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).Hope you're enjoying your work.

      "855: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfGreat to hear from you!  I got both messages.How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the laststraw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It wouldbe great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and ifyou could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman veryinformal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would begood for his English.Thinking of you \"up north\" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still sockedin, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul'ssprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees fromthe Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site ofPKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit ofimprovising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and makelives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from thecountryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a fewfolks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competingdifferences.All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live forthe reader.  But there's just so much \"stuff\" that makes up any givenpiece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around abit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to singlehandedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.More later.

      "858: X-Origin: SKILLING-JX-FileName: jskillin.nsfMom and Dad,Got mom's letter last week; and it only took about a week to get here.Thanks.  Enjoyed the pictures of Tom.Mom, you're right about a place to live.  Have a good one here.  A bitraw by US standards, but perfect for me.  Older building in interesting,\"real\" neighborhood; aesthetically pleasing apartment, with wood floors,ok molding, and super excellent, quintessential Istanbul view.  Thereare twelve apartments in the building, most of which are rented byMoslem families (veils and all).  A couple are used for storage by localbusinesses and one is rented by an English journalist.  Will get somepictures to you someday soon (though not taking many photos so far, aswant to experience this place as much in my brain, where the words are,as is possible).  Took a while to get my place reasonably comfortable,as had to buy furniture, etc, but that actually a lot of fun, in a way.Part of the experience, and I learned a lot.  Even had to install my ownlight fixtures.  No central-heating, so use one natural gas and oneelectric heater.  Ismail was/is very helpful in all ways, both withtechnical support and with help finding bargains.  I've been very lucky.Not \"running\" around too much.  Indeed, literally can't run.  Otherwise,my new hips performing flawlessly and thrilled at the absence of painand how strong they are.  Hoping to find an affordable pool around here,but such things not high on Turkey's needed infrastructure list.  Exceptfor super expensive pools in the luxury hotels ($25/day), very few poolsin Istanbul.  (Sorry Dad, no golf courses either.)Haven't worked too hard on trying to paint the \"big picture\" in mylittle blurbs.  But generally, go to Turkish classes three mornings aweek, starting at nine o'clock, for four hours each day.  Study a leastthat much on my own, not including trying to have \"real life\" Turkishlessons.  Work about 15 hours a week, not including preparation andtravelling time, which almost doubles that figure.  (Since each worksession usually only two hours, spend an inordinate amount of time onunpaid travelling; so far that's ok, as I enjoy the travelling, becauseI get to see odd parts of Istanbul.  That bit of charm will probablywear off over time.)  Have enjoyed figuring out the transit system, andhave gotten pretty good at using the buses, metro, the dolmas (somethingin between buses and taxis).  Cook at home a few times a week -- pasta,rice and veggies; things like that (there are tiny bakeries andvegitable stands everywhere)  -- though eating out here can be reallycheap and interesting.  Have two really good Turk friends now; Ismailand a wonderful women named Sukran (pronounced \"Shookrahn\").  Spend verylittle time with yabanci (foreigners, like me).  We spend a fair amountof time in cafes (which are bountiful and central to life her) talkingabout writing, politics, Turkish, etc.  At least once a week I go on along walk through a part of the city I haven't seen yet.  Ismial usuallyjoins me.  These are always amazing and are probably the most importantpart of my life here.  There's a Turkish newspaper that's written inEnglish, which I try to read most days.  Most days I also visit New YorkTimes and CNN web cites.  As you can see, taking this all veryseriously, am very busy and am loving every minute of it.More later.  Working on a blurb about a strange religious holiday we'rein the midst of right now.Thanks for your interest, which as I've mentioned before important forme.  And, especially, thanks for keeping in touch.Love,MarkGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n",

Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probablyonly us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in thestreets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up onsolid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad constructionhere; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half ablock from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparentinjuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not solucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed hada genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, menreading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in themiddle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks inneighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much Ilearned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, whichis depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much likeafter SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in mysubconscious.Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  Mayneed it.Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll sendthis to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok andworried about them worrying about me.Love,Mark>From: <tskilling@tribune.com>>To: \"Mark Skilling\" <markskilling@hotmail.com>>Subject: Re: earthquake---are you all right?>Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1999 21:55:16 -0500>>      Mark-->          Have just received word of the earthquake there.

      "19: Mr. Lay: Why couldn't you have worked with us?  This is  the worst time of year and being in a recession has negatively impacted my  prospects for work.

      "47: Mr. LayWe are getting blasted in the news and a lot of the information is false. There is NO one there to tell the complete truth.  Americans are getting the news that the media wants them to hear and it is not the full truth. Don't we need a spokesman to counter the lies? In the end even if there were no wrong doing, it won't matter because the media (and politicians) have said the same lies over and over and finally Americans believe it no matter if it is the truth or not. Day after day they have people on who say, \"I heard that Enron has fired 20,000 employees\".  They never have someone on that really knows.  And, \"Enron benefited from 17 provisions in this law\".  WELL - - so did Dynegy, and Williams and El Paso and on and on.  And, \"Enron only paid taxes one out of five years\".  WELL - - how many large companies did the same?  And, \"Ken Lay called O'Neil\".  WELL - - how many CEO's of large companies called him?  No one is there to represent Enron.  Enron has done things wrong, but it doesn't help if no one is there to stop the half truths and flat out lies. Please allow someone who has the knowledge and skills to go on TV and tell both sides. Thanks. Cecil\n",

Has President Bush set himselfup to follow the mistakes of his father by declaring thatrepeal of his tax cut would come only \"over my dead body\"?Has the White House misrepresented Majority LeaderDaschle's proposals by suggesting he is in favor of a taxincrease? Should everything be on the table in trying totackle the nation's economic losses? Will the presidentbe able to translate his high approval numbers on thewar on terrorism to the domestic front or have theDemocrats found an avenue to political success in 2002?Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), Chairman of the Natl. RepublicanCongressional Cmte. and Rep. Martin Frost (D-TX),Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, debate whichparty has the best road map for economic recovery.Then, this weekend a 15-year-old flight student piloteda small plane into a Tampa office building in an apparentsuicide. Does this incident reveal major gaps inmonitoring general aviation? Should there be a crackdownand greater regulation at flight schools or is that anoverreaction? Are small planes any more of a threat thantrucks or other vehicles? Could greater restrictions drivesmall airports out of business? Mike Pangia, a flightinstructor and former FAA attorney argues that no addedregulations are necessary while former NTSB ManagingDirector Peter Goelz says that additional oversight isa must.

      "72: ============================================================Greenfield at Large: Weeknights, 11:00 p.m. ETTuesday, January 08, 2002============================================================Here's the view from the ground in Afghanistan:\"...in Afghanistan you need more than smart bombs to wina war; you need cash. You need to pay fighters so theywon't loot, you need to buy food so they won't steal itand you need to purchase gas for their 4-by-4's. Mostcrucially, you need cash to entice enemy commanders andsoldiers to switch sides...The going rate last fall wasseveral thousand dollars for a midlevel commander and aslittle as $30 a head for soldiers.\"Here's another:\"'There was no al Qaeda group there,' Aji Akhter Jan saidof a U.S. airstrike Dec. 29 on a compound in easternAfghanistan. The Red Cross said the raid killed 52 people,nearly half of them children. Jan, an elderly, but robust-looking man who wears a black turban, Taliban-style, saidthe Americans were misled by an informant with a grudgeagainst two extended families who lived there.\"Those reports came from the New York Times and USA Today,respectively. They paint a picture of a nation wherealliances have less to do with the Taliban and theNorthern Alliance, and more to do with the Montagues andCapulets, or perhaps the Hatfields and the McCoys.Just this week, the 14-year-old suspected of shootingSgt. First Class Nathan Chapman has somehow disappearedfrom the custody of the Afghan elders holding him.Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar similarly seem to haveevaporated after Afghan forces reported having themsurrounded.Can the U.S. trust its supposed allies there? And ifnot, how can the U.S. military safely proceed in itssearch for remaining al Qaeda pockets? Perhaps moreworrisome, how can stability take hold in anenvironment where warring factions need chaos tothrive?Tonight, we'll hear from the reporters of thosestories, Peter Maass of the New York Times andSteven Komarow of USA Today, as well as CNN MilitaryAnalyst Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.). We hope you'lljoin us.(Note: Our guests and topic are subject to change.)======================================================Visit us online at http://www.cnn.com/greenfield or dropus an e-mail: greenfield@cnn.com.Read our privacy guidelines at:http://www.cnn.com/privacy.html(c) 2002 Cable News Network, Inc.An AOL Time Warner CompanyAll Rights Reserved.======================================================To unsubscribe, click here:http://cgi.cnn.com/cgi-bin/mail/clik?email=kenneth.lay@enron.com&list=greenfieldThis message was sent to you at kenneth.lay@enron.com\n",

After a U.S. congressman isasked to drop his trousers and a young Muslim woman hasto remove her head scarf, some are asking if airportsecurity has gone too far. Is security screening goingoverboard, or are these measures necessary to preventfuture terrorist attacks? Should more sensitivity beapplied to religious practices, or should everyone expectto be subjected to extensive searches? What is the bestway to keep the skies safe and not violate passengers'rights? We are joined by Enaas Sarsour, the young ladyasked to remove her head scarf at the Baltimore airportlast month, and then, two security experts debate whetherthe added barriers are equating to increased safetyin the air.Then, Robert Reich announced his candidacy forMassachusetts governor today and joins many of his formerClinton administration cabinet members in running forpublic office. Will they be running on the record of theirformer boss or running away from it? Can Former AttorneyGeneral Janet Reno and Former Energy Secretary BillRichardson escape the controversies that dogged them inoffice and become governors of their home states? FormerClinton White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart and topRepublican Strategist Charlie Black join us to discussthe candidates prospects.Join Bill Press and Tucker Carlson tonight on Crossfire,7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific.

Instead, we're focusing tonight onwhat happens IF it is. Is the U.S. any better preparednow than it was in October? What happened to all the talkabout ensuring that communities are ready to respond? Hasthe money been allocated? Plans formulated? We'll ask oneof the top advisors to Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge,Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.Then there's politics. The November elections and theailing economy have -- despite September 11's aftermath ofunity -- led to both parties sharpening their rhetoricalswords. And they're starting to get pulled from theirsheaths more often. This past weekend President Bush andSenate Majority Leader Tom Daschle took aim at each other.Is this what the country needs right now? Or is it ahealthy sign of a return to the normal give-and-take ofAmerica's political system? We'll debate these questionstonight with Susan Page of USA Today, Slate.com's JacobWeisberg and CNN Contributor Jonah Goldberg.

It do=esn't depend on the circumstances, the strength of your arm or your voice. = I hope you find this encouraging and uplifting. =20I wanted to share some verses with you both and some things that Oswald Cha=mbers says in his book His Utmost for His Highest.  \"My eager desire and ho=pe being that I may never feel ashamed, but that now as ever I may do honou=r to Christ in my own person by fearless courage.\" Phil. 1:20 =20\"We shall all feel ashamed if we do not yield to Jesus on the point He aske=d us to yield to Him.  To get there is a question of will, not of debate no=r of reasoning, but a surrender of will, an absolute and irrevocable surren=der on that point.  An over-weaning consideration for ourselves is the thin=g that keeps us from that decison, though we put it that we are considering= others.  When we consider what it will cost others if we obey the call of =Jesus, we tell God He does not know what our obedience will mean.  Keep to =the point;  He does know.  Shut out every other consideration and keep your=self before God for this one thing only- My Utmost for His Highest.  I am d=etermined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone. Whether =that means life or death, no matter.  Paul is determined that nothing shall= deter him from doing exactly what God wants.  God's order has to work up t=o a crisis in our lives because we will not ! heed the gentler way.   He br=ings us to the place where He askes us to be our utmost for Him, and we beg=in to debate; then He produces a providential crisis where we have to decid=e- for or against, and from that point the \"Great Divide\" begins.  If the c=risis has come to you on any line, surrender your will to Him absolutely an=d irrevocably.  What do you expect to do?  You do not know what you are goi=ng to do; the only thing you know is that God knows what He is doing.  Trus=t Him entirely.  You may not know what He will do next, but you have to tru=st He does.  We need to come in close contact with the teachings of Jesus C=hrist.  If we have never had the experience of taking our commonplace relig=ious shoes off our commonplace religious feet, and getting rid of all the u=ndue familiarity with which we approach God it is questionable whether we h=ave ever stood in His presence.\"God bless you during this time.  We will continue to pray for God's will in= your lives.Sincerely,Barbara T. Collins.\n",

      "25: Mr. Lay, I hope this note finds you in good health.   I wish you and your family a happy and healthy New Year. I am currently working with a group of former Enron  employees negotiating with several entities to join one of their  organizations to trade various commodities (excluding power and  gas).  A couple of the entities have shown definitive interest in  hiring the group, but our employment at Enron and employment contracts have  created significant issues.  In order for us to continue with the  discussions and the possibility of employment, we have been asked to provide a  letter from Enron representing that we have been released from the obligations  of our various employment contracts, specifically the non-compete  provision. I know you very interested in assisting former  Enron employees in succeeding with their lives and careers.  I would very  much appreciate your personal help and support in this  matter.  I spoke with Rosalee yesterday (January 10th) and  she suggested I email this note to you with the names of the other members of  this group that may have issues with their employment contracts.  The  individuals other than myself are Bryan Burnett, Jeff Ader and Mark  Bernstein.   Timing as always is important, I will follow up  with Rosalee Monday afternoon to determine a time that I can go the office to  pick up the letters. I know you have tremendous demands on your time  during this difficult period, I sincerely appreciate your attention and  support.  As before, if there is anything I can do for you or family,  please do not hesitate to contact me.   Thank you, Edward Ondarza713 850 0635 home713 412 5180 cell\n",

      "26: Dear Mr. Lay:You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.  I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.  Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.  I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.  Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.  With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.  However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.  I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.  Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.  I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.  I knew that since I was a ???survivor???, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ???critical employee???.  But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.  I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.  I was fortunate.  I found something immediately.  I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.  I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.  I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.  I was mistaken.  When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.  After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources.  I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ?? years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation.  I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation.  I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??\" that way they were assured $4,500.  I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month.  Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to.  What are the rules?  How should these situations have been handled?  Should not each employee be treated fairly?  Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay.  I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron.  I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down.  However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??\" ones that have yet to be recognized.  All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me.  I earned my vacation.  I worked hard and supported this company ??\" and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars.  I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future.  I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful.  Sincerely,Diana Monaghan    dmonaghan@houston.rr.com\n",

      "54: Mr. Lay, I just want you to know that I am praying for you constantly. Keep your eyes on Jesus and don't listen to what everyone is saying! He will say whatever He wants to say to you as you read the Word. He does not \"point the finger\" and accuse. In fact He doesn't even like that. (Isaiah 58:9  \"Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;\") That word vanity in the Hebrew means trouble, wickedness, sorrow. I guess that verse means you can't do it either even when they hurt you with their words. God will defend you. You said something about being old fashioned that the truth will prevail. That is not old fashioned .... that is God. You have that in your heart because you have Jesus in your heart. Believe God! He says \"if God is for us then who can be against us?\" What a WONDERFUL Word of Testimony you will have when this is finished. Remember, He brings us out of ALL our afflictions! (Psalm 34:19  \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.\")I listened to a teaching one time about Rev 12:11 \"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.\"  They said that the devil can't take the blood away from us and that he wants to destroy our testimony. Mr. Lay, you turned to Jesus in time of trouble. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You continually pray for guidance. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust in Him. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust that He will bring you through this. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You will tell the truth. That is part of this Word of Testimony. When all is said and done. God is going to show you and others (2 Chron 16:9  \"For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.\")I am telling you. That is what God showed me in the 16 Days readings. God testified of a perfect heart towards him. Yours. Not that you have done \"perfectly\"  but that you had a \"perfect heart towards him\". It is clearly shown in how you conduct yourself. I ran across these verses and thought you might like them to encourage you. 2 Sam 22:33  God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 1 Chron 29:12  Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.Psalm 62:11  God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. Isaiah 40:29  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. If your secretary could send me the dates you are to testify before Congress, it is on my heart to pray specifically for you while you testify.Thank you, Jesus, for your Word. Thank you for your servant, Mr. Lay. Thank you that you ARE going to get him THROUGH all of this. In Jesus name.

My working title is Ambition: The Rise and  Fall of Enron.  Perhaps the \"Fall\" is premature, but it will be revised  accordingly if a stunning comeback is achieved.  One of the advantages of a  longer book is that the last chapter will be on industry developments a year or  two out to see there things really land with or without Enron. What I have in mind is a two-year research and  writing project--or longer.  It would develop your history through  Transco and then begin when John Duncan recruited you to Enron.  The  history, unlike the books we are likely to see in the next year,  would fully develop a number of energy, political economy, and corporate  culture themes.  I will, of course, bring in all the recent and  forthcoming events as the climax, but the buildup is what will distinguish  the book.  I anticipate it would be akin to \"The Prize,\" but instead of the  \"epic quest for oil, money, and power\" the Enron story would be the \"epic\"  or \"fatal\" quest to create the world's leading company. This is a book for history.  The operative  word is understanding.  The book is not intended to preserve Enron's  legacy or your legacy per se but to teach the world about what happened and  why.  There will be many positives in the story but there will be  negatives--maybe a lot of negatives.  I will be happy to discuss some  of my hypotheses of the negatives and sensitivities with you up  front.  I truly believe that a totally candid analysis of the situation is  the best legacy that Enron or you can bequeath to the business and public policy  world.  Personally for all of us who have been hurt, it is the best  foundation to move forward and once again hang our heads high.  The past  cannot be undone.  (And interestingly, there is a remarkable historical  precedent for what happened to Enron and you in the energy-centered story  of Samuel Insull--so you have pretty good company.) I heard through the grapevine that you are thinking  of writing your own book.  That is a good idea for several reasons.   But I want to discuss what my book would be about in the hopes that I can  interview you over the course of the research and writing.  If  so, your autobiography could come after my book where you face up  to all the tough questions and have the \"last say.\"  You would also  have a secure foundation from my book with all your  accomplishments. I have about a month to finish a detailed  outline of the book and produce some writing samples.  An agent will shop  the proposal around, and we will see if the advance is enough to proceed.   (I got fairly wiped out by the crash.)  I am also investigating having  a co-author involved on the \"Fall\" side, while I work on the \"Rise\"  side.  I also might get some foundations or investors involved to make the  economics work, and the early indication is that there will be support.  A  lot of people would be very supportive of a full history rather than what  we are likely to see in the next year. I have a PowerPoint presentation on the potential  book and will be happy to visit with you.  It might be better to visit at  the Huntington, but the office is fine also.  My home and work phone is  713-266-3934. Best wishes, - Rob\n",
